Markdown Content:
Since its introduction, the [NVIDIA Hopper architecture](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/hopper-architecture/?srsltid=AfmBOoo3z76Q-w79irSnBgfCISJInSPhfxdLVlfO64tKyjudVY_TGU7I) has transformed the AI and high-performance computing (HPC) landscape, helping enterprises, researchers and developers tackle the world’s most complex challenges with higher performance and greater energy efficiency.

During the [Supercomputing 2024](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/supercomputing/?srsltid=AfmBOorUSrestIX8obYfGXXinVpEbB1c0KCEONLpVA6h7npd9U1S8YX1) conference, NVIDIA announced the availability of the [NVIDIA H200 NVL PCIe GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h200/#h200nvl) — the latest addition to the Hopper family. H200 NVL is ideal for organizations with data centers looking for lower-power, air-cooled enterprise rack designs with flexible configurations to deliver acceleration for every AI and HPC workload, regardless of size.

According to a recent survey, roughly 70% of enterprise racks are 20kW and below and use air cooling. This makes PCIe GPUs essential, as they provide granularity of node deployment, whether using one, two, four or eight GPUs — enabling data centers to pack more computing power into smaller spaces. Companies can then use their existing racks and select the number of GPUs that best suits their needs.

Enterprises can use H200 NVL to accelerate AI and HPC applications, while also improving energy efficiency through reduced power consumption. With a 1.5x memory increase and 1.2x bandwidth increase over NVIDIA H100 NVL, companies can use H200 NVL to fine-tune LLMs within a few hours and deliver up to 1.7x faster inference performance. For HPC workloads, performance is boosted up to 1.3x over H100 NVL and 2.5x over the NVIDIA Ampere architecture generation.

Complementing the raw power of the H200 NVL is [NVIDIA NVLink](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink/) technology. The latest generation of NVLink provides GPU-to-GPU communication 7x faster than fifth-generation PCIe — delivering higher performance to meet the needs of HPC, large language model inference and fine-tuning.

The NVIDIA H200 NVL is paired with powerful software tools that enable enterprises to accelerate applications from AI to HPC. It comes with a five-year subscription for [NVIDIA AI Enterprise](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/?srsltid=AfmBOop07IINaYG6TIxcC6N9Pi9K8xoRD4Tj-QcOys5s_j6ulA7i-R7c), a cloud-native software platform for the development and deployment of production AI. NVIDIA AI Enterprise includes [NVIDIA NIM](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/?srsltid=AfmBOoorqOfFNxcEbwD0GtMYVA97BPUwT7vnEBF8ZRr2dZWRPMlBdz3t) microservices for the secure, reliable deployment of high-performance AI model inference.

**Companies Tapping Into Power of H200 NVL**

Title: What Is NVLink?

URL Source: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-nvidia-nvlink/

Published Time: 2023-03-06T16:00:31+00:00

Markdown Content:
[Accelerated computing](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-accelerated-computing/) —  a capability once confined to high-performance computers in government research labs — has gone mainstream.

Banks, car makers, factories, hospitals, retailers and others are adopting AI supercomputers to tackle the growing mountains of data they need to process and understand.

These powerful, efficient systems are superhighways of computing. They carry data and calculations over parallel paths on a lightning journey to actionable results.

GPU and CPU processors are the resources along the way, and their onramps are fast interconnects. The gold standard in interconnects for accelerated computing is [NVLink](https://www.nvidia.com/object/nvlink.html).

NVLink is a high-speed connection for GPUs and CPUs formed by a robust software protocol, typically riding on multiple pairs of wires printed on a computer board. It lets processors send and receive data from shared pools of memory at lightning speed.

[![Image 19: A diagram showing two NVLink uses](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/NVLink-types-672x223.jpg)](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/NVLink-types-scaled.jpg)

Now in its fourth generation, NVLink connects host and accelerated processors at rates up to 900 gigabytes per second (GB/s).

That’s more than 7x the bandwidth of PCIe Gen 5, the interconnect used in conventional x86 servers. And NVLink sports 5x the energy efficiency of PCIe Gen 5, thanks to data transfers that consume just 1.3 picojoules per bit.

**The History of NVLink**
-------------------------

First introduced as a GPU interconnect with the NVIDIA P100 GPU, NVLink has advanced in lockstep with each new NVIDIA GPU architecture.

[![Image 20: A chart of the basic specifications for NVLink](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/NVLink-specs-672x134.jpg)](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/NVLink-specs.jpg)

In 2018, NVLink hit the spotlight in high performance computing when it debuted connecting GPUs and CPUs in two of the world’s most powerful supercomputers, [Summit and Sierra](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/summit-gpu-supercomputer-enables-smarter-science/).

The systems, installed at Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, are pushing the boundaries of science in fields such as [drug discovery](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/covid-ai-gordon-bell-winner/), [natural disaster prediction](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/summit-earthquake-understanding/) and more.

**Bandwidth Doubles, Then Grows Again**
---------------------------------------

In 2020, the third-generation NVLink doubled its max bandwidth per GPU to 600GB/s, packing a dozen interconnects in every [NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/).

The A100 powers AI supercomputers in enterprise data centers, cloud computing services and HPC labs across the globe.

Today, 18 fourth-generation NVLink interconnects are embedded in a single [NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/). And the technology has taken on a new, strategic role that will enable the most advanced CPUs and accelerators on the planet.

**A Chip-to-Chip Link**
-----------------------

[NVIDIA NVLink-C2C](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink-c2c/) is a version of the board-level interconnect to join two processors inside a single package, creating a superchip. For example, it connects two CPU chips to deliver 144 Arm Neoverse V2 cores in the [NVIDIA Grace CPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-cpu/) Superchip, a processor built to deliver energy-efficient performance for cloud, enterprise and HPC users.

NVIDIA NVLink-C2C also joins a Grace CPU and a Hopper GPU to create the [Grace Hopper Superchip](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/). It packs accelerated computing for the world’s toughest HPC and AI jobs into a single chip.

[Alps](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/cpu-grace-cscs-alps/), an AI supercomputer planned for the Swiss National Computing Center, will be among the first to use Grace Hopper. When it comes online later this year, the high-performance system will work on big science problems in fields from astrophysics to quantum chemistry.

[![Image 21: The Grace CPU uses NVLink-C2C](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/grace-cpu-superchip-press-gtc22-spring-1600x900-1-672x378.jpg)](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/grace-cpu-superchip-press-gtc22-spring-1600x900-1.jpg)

The Grace CPU packs 144 Arm Neoverse V2 cores across two die connected by NVLink-C2C.

Grace and Grace Hopper are also great for bringing energy efficiency to demanding cloud computing workloads.

For example, Grace Hopper is an ideal processor for [recommender systems](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/grace-hopper-recommender-systems/). These economic engines of the internet need fast, efficient access to lots of data to serve trillions of results to billions of users daily.

[![Image 22: A chart showing how Grace Hopper uses NVLink to deliver leading performance on recommendation systems](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Grace-Hopper-for-recommenders-672x420.jpg)](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Grace-Hopper-for-recommenders.jpg)

Recommenders get up to 4x more performance and greater efficiency using Grace Hopper than using Hopper with traditional CPUs.

In addition, NVLink is used in a powerful system-on-chip for automakers that includes NVIDIA Hopper, Grace and Ada Lovelace processors. [NVIDIA DRIVE Thor](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-unveils-drive-thor-centralized-car-computer-unifying-cluster-infotainment-automated-driving-and-parking-in-a-single-cost-saving-system) is a car computer that unifies intelligent functions such as digital instrument cluster, infotainment, automated driving, parking and more into a single architecture.

**LEGO Links of Computing**
---------------------------

NVLink also acts like the socket stamped into a LEGO piece. It’s the basis for building supersystems to tackle the biggest HPC and AI jobs.

For example, NVLinks on all eight GPUs in an [NVIDIA DGX system](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-systems/) share fast, direct connections via NVSwitch chips. Together, they enable an NVLink network where every GPU in the server is part of a single system.

To get even more performance, DGX systems can themselves be stacked into modular units of 32 servers, creating a powerful, efficient [computing cluster](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-cluster-pod/).

[![Image 23: A picture of the DGX family of server products that use NVLink](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DGX-system-SuperPOD-672x363.jpg)](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DGX-system-SuperPOD.jpg)

NVLink is one of the key technologies that let users easily scale modular NVIDIA DGX systems to a SuperPOD with up to an exaflop of AI performance.

Users can connect a modular block of 32 DGX systems into a single AI supercomputer using a combination of an NVLink network inside the DGX and [NVIDIA Quantum-2](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/quantum2/) switched Infiniband fabric between them. For example, an NVIDIA DGX H100 SuperPOD packs 256 H100 GPUs to deliver up to an [exaflop](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-an-exaflop) of peak AI performance.

To get even more performance, users can tap into the AI supercomputers in the cloud such as the one Microsoft Azure is building with [tens of thousands of A100 and H100 GPUs](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-microsoft-accelerate-cloud-enterprise-ai). It’s a service used by groups like OpenAI to train some of the world’s largest generative AI models.

And it’s one more example of the power of accelerated computing.

Title: Comcast and Broadcom to Develop the World’s First AI-Powered Access Network with Pioneering New Chipset

URL Source: https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-broadcom-develop-ai-powered-access-network-pioneering-new-chipset

Published Time: 2023-10-17T19:05:00+00:00

Markdown Content:
Philadelphia, PA

Comcast and Broadcom today announced joint efforts to develop the world’s first AI-powered access network with a new chipset that embeds artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) within the nodes, amps and modems that comprise the last few miles of Comcast’s network.

With these new capabilities broadly deployed throughout the network, Comcast will be able to transform its operations by automating more network functions and deliver an improved customer experience through better and more actionable intelligence.

Additionally, the new chipset will be the first in the world to incorporate DOCSIS 4.0 Full Duplex (FDX), Extended Spectrum (ESD) and the ability to run both simultaneously, enabling Internet service providers across the globe to deliver DOCSIS 4.0 services using a toolkit with technology options to meet their business needs. DOCSIS 4.0 is the next-generation network technology that will introduce symmetrical multi-gigabit Internet speeds, lower latency, and even better security and reliability to hundreds of millions of people and businesses over their existing connections without the need for major construction of new network infrastructure.

On October 12, Comcast [announced](https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-multi-gig-symmetrical-speeds-world-first-docsis-4-deployment) that it will begin to introduce the first customers in the world to Internet services powered by DOCSIS 4.0 using FDX. While the company will continue to leverage FDX, the collaboration with Broadcom will provide Comcast and other operators with additional options in the pursuit of delivering the best possible connectivity experience.

> The Xfinity 10G Network leverages the latest advancements in edge compute, digital optics and real-time, actionable telemetry to meet and exceed our customers’ constantly evolving connectivity needs.

“With this new Unified DOCSIS4 chipset from Broadcom, we can broadly deploy transformational AI network capabilities alongside symmetrical multi-gig speeds. FDX is the best technology for Comcast, but this groundbreaking unified chipset will provide the entire industry with options when upgrading their nodes, amps, and cable modems for DOCSIS 4.0,” said Elad Nafshi, Chief Network Officer, Comcast Cable.

The new end-to-end chipsets will be the industry’s first to incorporate AI and ML capabilities that will transform the operations and customer experience functions by:

*   Making smarter network performance decisions using network diagnostics insights produced by both local and cloud AI.
*   Enhanced monitoring and issue detection using bandwidth-efficient telemetry data.
*   Transforming network maintenance of the network using real time issue localization plus predictive and self-healing network intelligence.
*   Protecting network facilities and customers with improved cybersecurity intrusion detection.
*   Assisting customers more effectively through local and cloud-based AI.
*   Monitoring home IoT devices for connectivity disruptions.

All these capabilities, and more, are achieved while reducing network latency and insulating customer data to ensure the utmost privacy standards.

“By enabling a toolkit that includes FDX, ESD or both simultaneously, this new Unified DOCSIS4 chipset incorporates the advantages of both technologies and will enable economies of scale as well as a common retail modem for the industry,” said Rich Nelson, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Broadband Video Group, Broadcom. “The edge network and in-home capabilities of this chipset will improve network intelligence and reliability to create an improved broadband experience with enhanced privacy protection and cyber security for the consumer.”

Comcast and Broadcom are designing and building the new chipset based upon CableLabs’ DOCSIS 4.0 specifications. The companies have a history of working together to introduce innovations that have pushed the industry to the next generation of connectivity. In 2021, Comcast [conducted](https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-conducts-ull-duplex-chip-multi-gigabit-symmetrical-speeds) the world’s first full duplex multi-gigabit symmetrical test on Broadcom-built silicon. In January 2022 the companies [tested](https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/world-first-test-10g-modem-technology-multigigabit-speeds-to-homes) the first Full Duplex DOCSIS 4.0 system-on-chip (SoC) cable modem that delivered symmetrical speeds faster than 4 Gbps. Later that year, Comcast successfully [tested](https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-10g-powered-multi-gigabit-symmetrical-speeds-network) the final technical component of necessary to deliver multi-gig symmetrical speed powered by DOCSIS 4.0 throughout its network with 10G smart amps built on a Broadcom-developed reference design.

The companies expect to begin trials early in 2024 and to begin deploying the new chipset in live networks before the end of the same year.

Broadcom Inc 's Comment on Competition and Industry Peers



The semiconductor industry in general, and wired and wireless communications markets in particular, are intensely competitive and are characterized by constant innovation, rapid change, rapid cadence through technology standards, short product life cycles and steady price erosion. We believe that the principal factors of competition for integrated circuit providers in general, or their product offerings in particular, include:

product quality and reputation
market presence
product capabilities
standards compliance
level of integration
system cost
engineering execution and scale
breadth of intellectual property
reliability
customer interface and support
power efficiency
time-to-market
circuit board footprint
security

We also compete with suppliers of system-level and motherboard-level solutions incorporating integrated circuits that are proprietary or sourced from manufacturers other than Broadcom. This competition, along with Moores law, has resulted and may continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products in certain markets. We also may face competition from newly established competitors, suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies, and customers that choose to develop their own silicon solutions. We also expect to encounter consolidation in the markets in which we compete.

Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. Current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers, resellers or other third parties, and may refuse to provide us with information necessary to permit the interoperability of our products with theirs. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. In addition, competitors may develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features, lower power requirements or lower costs. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Report for further discussion of the risks associated with competition.

The semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets are intensely competitive. We expect competition to continue to increase as new markets develop, as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter our business. We expect to encounter further consolidation in the markets in which we compete.

Some of our competitors have longer operating histories and presences in key markets, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical and other resources than we do, and in some cases operate their own fabrication facilities. These competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. We also face competition from newly established competitors, suppliers of products, and customers who choose to develop their own semiconductor solutions.

Existing or new competitors may develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features and functionality, lower power requirements, lower cost or greater levels of integration. The trend of increasingly integrated SoCs and chipset solutions in particular could pose a risk to various lines of our business, as customers may opt for a solution that includes functionality that was previously sourced from us on a standalone basis.

Increased competition also has resulted in and is likely to continue to result in increased expenditures on research and development, a decline in average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in certain markets. These factors in turn create increased pressure to consolidate. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against current or new competitors. If we do not compete successfully, we may lose market share in our existing markets and our revenues may fail to increase or may decline.

Title: Broadcom’s VMware strategy: A plan that will reshape IT

URL Source: https://digitalsunshinesolutions.com/broadcoms-vmware-strategy-a-plan-that-will-reshape-it/

I wrote about mourning the VMware vCommunity in [this blog post](https://digitalsunshinesolutions.com/mourning-our-vcommunity-navigating-grief-after-the-broadcom-acquisition/). However, every technical community evolves as technology changes. The question we should be asking ourselves is: how is Broadcom’s VMware strategy reshaping the virtualization market?

Which segment of the server virtualization market is Broadcom interested in?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let’s examine this from a business perspective.

In product marketing, we talk about TAM when we start thinking about how to position and market a product. TAM stands for the total addressable market. Put simply, TAM represents the total customer base you could reach if you managed to sell to every potential buyer of your product.

I left VMware at the end of 2019. When I was there, VMware owned 95% of virtualized server workloads. The TAM for server virtualization is still huge, [one estimate](https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/server-virtualization-market-3981) has it growing to almost $13B by 2032.

It’s clear that VMware doesn’t have that complete market domination it once had. For one thing, the share of workloads owned by VMware has decreased over the years due to the rise of cloud and containerized computing technologies. Additionally, the overall TAM includes VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure), and we know that [Broadcom sold off the EUC (End User Computing) business uni](https://www.techtarget.com/searchvirtualdesktop/news/366571378/Broadcom-to-sell-VMware-EUC-division-to-KKR-for-38B)t which included Workspace One and Horizon.

Now we have a clear picture of the TAM, it’s easier to talk about Broadcom’s VMware strategy. First let’s talk about where Broadcom’s SAM and SOM in this market.

Quick acronym break 
--------------------

But y’all didn’t realize product marketers had their own acronyms, did ya? Let’s break down these acronyms:

*   **TAM (Total addressable market**): the total customer base you could reach if you managed to sell to every potential buyer of your product   
    We covered the server virtualization market TAM in the section above. One estimate is $13B. 
*   **SAM** **(Service addressable market)**: This is the section of the TAM a business could realistically target and serve.    
    Broadcom is bowing out of the EUC portion of the server virtualization market, so we know they are looking specifically at server virtualization. 
*   **SOM (Service obtainable market):** This is the portion of the SAM that a business could reasonably capture.    
    These are the customers and verticals that a business will spend time and money on. Broadcom has been extremely clear about who that will be. 

![Image 12](https://digitalsunshinesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/tam-sam-som.jpg)

Broadcom tightens their focus 
------------------------------

Even before the acquisition closed, Broadcom consistently identified the part of the server virtualization market they would go after. [This Register article reported on the Broadcom Investor day](https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/30/broadcom_strategy_vmware_customer_impact/), where the Broadcom VMware plan was out for investors back in November 2021.

*   **Broadcom’s VMware strategy:** Focus on 600 key customers in highly regulated industries, reducing sales and marketing costs, and trimming R&D by not catering to smaller customers 
*   Approximately 70% of Broadcom’s ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) will come from those key customers.  
*   Broadcom wants to keep the VMware customers with the following characteristics: in highly regulated industries, risk-adverse, “a lot of heterogeneity and complexity” in their IT departments that makes them less likely to change suppliers, companies with high budgets that are increasing quickly, and those that can’t go all-in on the public cloud. 

By tightening their SOM to only 600 customers, Broadcom can slash sales and marketing costs. And that’s exactly where the brutal layoffs at VMware have happened. That’s why it makes no sense to us that such talented people were summarily dismissed, and why VMware has slashed personnel to the bone. It is part of Broadcom’s VMware strategy, just business. Of course, that only makes it hurt more.

The Register offered this quote about the commercial customers: “Krause said Broadcom is content to have those 100,000 customers “trail” over time.”

Details of Broadcom’s VMware Strategy
-------------------------------------

![Image 13: A slide describing the details of Broadcom's VMware Strategy](https://digitalsunshinesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.jpeg)

This is image is via the Register article about the analyst briefing. Broadcom’s VMware strategy is laid out pretty plainly in this slide.

But this is not a new strategy for the company. Broadcom used the same runbook after the CA and Symantec acquisitions. For comparison, consider this. Both of those companies spent 29% of their revenue on sales and marketing before their respective acquisitions. Broadcom usually spends 7%. Guess that explains the stripped down VMworld.

Before the acquisition, VMware spent more than 34% of its revenue on sales and marketing. Dropping that spend to 7% will save Broadcom $216M a quarter (according to El Reg). That’s important because Broadcom expects VMware to contribute $8.5B to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) within three years of the deal closing.  Before the acquisition VMware stood at approximately $4.7B to EBITDA. They have lots of work to do.

Their costs are already down. In the first earnings call post-acquisitions [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/13/broadcom_q2_2024/) reports that CEO Hock Tan said: “Broadcom targeted quarterly costs of $1.4 billion but is on track to exit 2024 with costs at $1.3 billion – and can reduce them further to $1.2 billion.”

VMware prices skyrocket
-----------------------

And of course, the cost for the software has gone up. This tweet, via [Jason Thomas](https://x.com/cioontherun/status/1760770717040115988), is not unusual.

![Image 14: a tweet describing how the VMware prices have skyrocketed. Text reads: Can confirm a current @Broadcom @VMware customer went from an M renewal to 0M. There's a word I'm thinking of and it's on the tip of my tongue. Please help me.](https://digitalsunshinesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1024x431.png)

The academic licensing program and pricing for non-profits have also been suspended. [This article](https://www.crn.com/news/virtualization/2024/broadcom-tells-partner-negotiating-for-charity-vmware-is-not-for-everybody) talks about a children’s hospital charity that could not afford the increased licensing costs. The charity faced a six to eight times price on their renewal, and they ended up paying the Broadcom ransom. To add insult to injury, Broadcom told them “‘I’m sorry, VMware is not for everyone.”

Broadcom’s VMware strategy certainly is creating chaos in the market. But chaos is what drives innovation.

It will be interesting to see how much headway Broadcom has made with their strategy this year. The Q3 earnings call is coming up on September 5. Want to listen in? [Here are the details for how to attend.](https://investors.broadcom.com/events/event-details/q3-2024-broadcom-earnings-conference-call) These calls are always a great way to understand the market better.

If you’re interested in the view from a former Symantec employee who stayed for a year after the acquisition. They lay out the Broadcom acquisition playbook for VMware employees in [this blog post](https://kicksec.io/broadcom-acquires-vmware/).

What does Broadcom’s VMware strategy mean for customers? 
---------------------------------------------------------

Broadcom has a narrow, well-defined SOM for VMware. Broadcom’s VMware strategy is to focus on a small number of customers who will find it better to remain locked-in than to look for alternatives. By doing this, they will reduce their sales, marketing, engineering, and support costs.

I use the word “locked-in” intentionally. Broadcom communicated their plans well before the acquisition closed to only focus on customers who could not easily move to another virtualization platform.

The VMware portfolio has gone from hundreds of offerings to 4. This has led to extreme price increases. But to be honest, that exercise started when I was there. Someone needed to pull that band aid off!  However, $8M to $100M is a hard pill to swallow.

According to this [CIODive article](https://www.ciodive.com/news/broadcom-vmware-lock-in-cost-disruption/718281/), Tracy Woo (principal Forrester analyst) called this an effort to divorce their customers. She said, “They’re not trying to play nice and then stab you in the back,” Woo said. “They’re holding the knife right to you and saying, ‘This is what you have to do or you’re out.’”

Broadcom’s VMware strategy is how they are thinning out the 100K customers, and it’s how they are pressuring their top 600 to stay with them. According to the same article, 95% of respondents to a CloudBolt survey see Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware as disruptive to their business, 75% anticipate a price hike of greater than 100%, and only 5% have decided what to do.

Broadcom’s VMware strategy means the wild (competitive) rumpus start! 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, there is an opening for true competition in the virtual world! One reason VMware owned the market is because the product is solid. It has every feature an enterprise would want or need.

One thing I found amazing when I worked at VMware is how in step the engineering teams were with the hardware vendors. If there was a new chip or server feature being announced, most times VMware could virtualize it on release day.

VMware just worked. OK, sometimes it was a pain to upgrade it. But that was largely because over the years it became such a critical part of the infrastructure. Systems are harder to update the larger they become.

I mean, come on….who can forget [the first time they saw vMotion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvIztSllCoQ) in action?

VMware became the gold standard because it **_IS_** the gold standard! But Broadcom is making it clear that if you want to use the current gold standard, you’re gonna have to pay the ransom.  That is going to clear the decks for competition. And that is where the vCommunity comes in.

Expand your view of virtualization and grow the community
---------------------------------------------------------

VMware != virtualization anymore. Don’t get me wrong, it will probably always be the best package money can buy. This is because Broadcom will concentrate the engineering work to make all the VMware offerings a single, cohesive product. That was a big part of the announcements last week at VMware Explore. However, it will be priced so smaller organizations won’t be able to afford it.

The most pressing problem for organizations right now is choosing a replacement virtualization platform that will fit your business needs. The bigger challenge will be how to migrate your systems over to the new platform. Both of these challenges are meaty technical problems. But that’s exactly what our community does best – figure out solutions to hard technical problems. And then teach everyone else how to do it.

In my next post, I will outline the 10,000-foot explanation of the technical problems. This is where we can dig in collectively and dig out of our grief. Broadcom has made their business decision, now it’s time for us to make our own.

Have you found any interesting solutions or aids for people to move workloads off of VMware? Let us know in the comments!

Title: Drivenets Network Cloud AI Launches with Broadcom Jericho 3 AI

URL Source: https://drivenets.com/news-and-events/press-release/drivenets-network-cloud-ai-available-with-broadcom-jericho-3-ai/

Markdown Content:
**Ra’anana Israel** – October 17, 2023 – [DriveNets](https://drivenets.com/) – a leader in innovative networking solutions – today announced that its Network Cloud-AI software, supporting Broadcom’s Jericho 3-AI based white boxes and Ramon 3 chipset, is available for order. This second [AI networking solution](https://drivenets.com/solutions/ai-networking/) from DriveNets is based on [Network Cloud-AI which was introduced in May](https://drivenets.com/news-and-events/press-release/drivenets-introduces-highest-performance-ethernet-solution-for-ai-networking/) supporting white boxes based on Broadcom’s Jericho 2C+. Built on DriveNets’ [Network Cloud](https://drivenets.com/products/) – which is deployed in the world’s largest networks, DriveNets Network Cloud-AI supports the highest-performance, fully scheduled networking system based on open standard Ethernet. It therefore maximizes the utilization of AI infrastructures and improves the performance of large-scale AI workloads regardless of GPU or AI accelerator used, enabling hyperscalers and other AI infrastructure builders to build an open, multi-vendor AI infrastructure. DriveNets Network Cloud-AI was validated by leading hyperscalers in early trials as the top performing Ethernet solution for AI networking.

**Early availability of Jericho3AI based high-scale AI networking**  
---------------------------------------------------------------------

DriveNets Network Cloud-AI is based on OCP’s Distributed Disaggregated Chassis (DDC) architecture, providing a predictable lossless Ethernet connectivity that minimizes GPU idle cycles and maximizes the utilization of the AI infrastructure. The availability of Network Cloud-AI software and [Jericho3AI based white boxes](https://drivenets.com/blog/ai-networking-moves-ahead-with-drivenets-and-broadcom-jericho3-ai/) allows builders of AI infrastructures to have a highest-performance, fully scheduled networking system available in the market today, based on open standard Ethernet.

“We are thrilled to see DriveNets maximizing the value of the DDC architecture in AI networking,” said Ram Velaga, senior vice president and general manager, Core Switching Group, Broadcom. “We designed J3AI to perform as the best networking ASIC for AI, in the market. DriveNets Network Cloud allows it to scale out to its maximum cluster capacity of 32K 800G ports, delivering ultimate AI performance at scale.”

“As a premier network leader in design of open hardware platforms for data centers, enterprise and carrier networks, Accton is very excited by the introduction of DDC into AI-networking,” said Michael K T Lee, Sr. Vice President of Research and Development Center, “Teaming up with innovative companies such as DriveNets and Broadcom accelerates the growth of the AI ecosystem and enables the best-performing, open standard AI infrastructure.”

**Highest performance AI networking validated by an independent lab** 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Independent testing by the leading scalable data center simulation lab [Scala Computing](https://www.scalacomputing.com/) validates the early hyperscaler trial findings that DriveNets Network Cloud-AI delivers the highest-performance Ethernet fabric for large-scale AI compute clusters.

Scala’s test results proved that Network Cloud-AI improves Job Completion Time (JCT) performance by more than 10% for workloads running on a large-scale AI training cluster with 2000 GPUs, optimizing GPU resource utilization and reducing idle time.

In addition, test results proved that Network Cloud-AI is optimized for GPU noisy neighbor scenarios, ensuring no performance impact on other AI jobs running in parallel. This is not the case with Ethernet CLOS solutions where all AI jobs running on the same node are impacted. A GPU noisy neighbor scenario occurs when the performance of one or more GPUs is negatively affected by the activity of other GPUs on the same node. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as resource contention on the network or performance degradation on the NIC.

The Network Cloud AI solution introduced today supports the highest JCT performance of 800G GPU/AI accelerators for Ethernet, enabling faster training and deployment of large-scale AI models. It was designed to support greater scale than tested to date of 32,000 GPUs/AI accelerators with 800G ports.

“Scala Computing’s test results demonstrate that DriveNets Network Cloud-AI is the highest-performance Ethernet alternative for AI networking for hyperscalers and large organizations that are building large-scale AI clusters,” said Ido Susan, DriveNets co-founder and CEO. “DriveNets’ AI solution unlocks AI vendor dependency, enabling organizations building AI infrastructures to select any mix of AI chipset, network interface cards (NICs) or server OEM to meet their specific needs.”

“The pace and magnitude of AI infrastructure buildouts continues to grow while standard Ethernet solutions struggle to deliver the performance and reliability that will maximize the utilization of the AI resources.” said Rob Zecha, Scala Computing COO. “Plans for AI cluster sizes expand faster than the ability of the AI infrastructure eco-system to support them. AI networking is a critical element that has a huge impact on the size of the AI cluster and the quality of its performance. The AI networking performance at scale demonstrated by DriveNets is exactly what our industry needs.”

**DriveNets Contribution to OCP DDC Standard Accepted** 
--------------------------------------------------------

As part of the effort to maintain DDC’s position as the most innovative, proven networking technology, the contribution to [OCP DDC specification version 3](https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ddc-v3-ocp-base-specification-revision-5-0-pdf) made by DriveNets alongside AT&T, HPE, Intel and UfiSpace – the newest version of the standard – has been accepted. The contribution is based on DriveNets Network Cloud architecture and addresses Ethernet Networking for high-performance AI workloads in huge-scale clusters.

The Open Compute Project’s DDC specification continues to evolve and address new market needs with new solutions developed by DriveNets, other software and hardware vendors, and operators. It provides network operators and AI infrastructure builders with tools to make their networking operations more flexible and cost effective.

Version 1 of the DDC spec was contributed by AT&T and focused on the distributed disaggregated model. Version focused on software and hardware interoperability. This latest addition – Version 3, adds support for new devices based on Broadcom’s Jericho 3-AI and Ramon 3 ASICs as well as advances the OCP DDC into Mobile networks. It also simplifies network management and addresses higher scale suited for AI networking.

“The DDC architecture enables service providers and hyperscalers to maximize the scale and performance of their networks using standard networking white boxes,” said Vincent Ho, UfiSpace CEO. “Without the interdependencies of a complicated chassis-based architecture, we can accelerate our development cycles and introduce new hardware in record time, allowing our customers to accelerate the deployment of their infrastructures while optimizing their operations and cost.”

Broadcom Inc. is an American multinational designer, developer, manufacturer, and global supplier of a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. Broadcom's product offerings serve the data center, networking, software, broadband, wireless, storage, and industrial markets. As of 2024, some 58 percent of Broadcom's revenue came from its semiconductor-based products and 42 percent from its infrastructure software products and services.[1]: 43 

Tan Hock Eng is the company's president and CEO.[4][5] The company is headquartered in Palo Alto, California.[6] Avago Technologies Limited took the Broadcom part of the Broadcom Corporation name after acquiring it in January 2016. The ticker symbol AVGO which represented old Avago now represents the newly merged entity. The Broadcom Corporation ticker symbol BRCM was retired. At first the merged entity was known as Broadcom Limited, before assuming the present name in November 2017.

In October 2019, the European Union issued an interim antitrust order against Broadcom concerning anticompetitive business practices which allegedly violate European Union competition law.[7]

In May 2022, Broadcom announced an agreement to acquire VMware in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at $69 billion. The acquisition was closed on November 22, 2023.[8]

Amid the AI boom, the company's market capitalization exceeded US$1 trillion for the first time in December 2024, making Broadcom one of the most valuable companies in the world.[9]

History[edit]
Origin in Hewlett-Packard[edit]

The company that would later become Broadcom Inc. was established in 1961 as HP Associates, a semiconductor products division of Hewlett-Packard.[10]

The division separated from Hewlett-Packard as part of the Agilent Technologies spinoff in 1999.[11][12]

Formation of Avago Technologies[edit]

KKR and Silver Lake Partners acquired the Semiconductor Products Group of Agilent Technologies in 2005 for $2.6 billion and formed Avago Technologies.[11] Avago Technologies agreed to sell its I/O solutions unit to PMC-Sierra for $42.5 million in October 2005.[13]

In August 2008, the company filed an initial public offering of $400 million.[14][15] In October 2008, Avago Technologies acquired Infineon Technologies' Munich-based bulk acoustic wave business for €21.5 million.[16]

On 6 August 2009, Avago Technologies went public on NASDAQ with the ticker symbol AVGO.[12][17]

Avago Technologies announced its agreement to acquire CyOptics, an optical chip and component supplier, for $400 million in April 2013.[18][19] The acquisition aimed to expand Avago Technologies' fiber optics product portfolio.[19] In October 2013, Avago Technologies invested $5 million in Amantys, a power electronics technology provider, as part of a strategic investment agreement between the two companies.[20]

Avago Technologies announced its agreement to acquire LSI Corporation in December 2013 for $6.6 billion.[11][21][17][22][23] The acquisition helped move Avago Technologies away from specialized products and towards a more mainstream industry, which included chips, especially storage for data centers.[23]

The company sold its SSD controller business to Seagate Technology in May 2014.[24] In August 2014, the company was the ninth-largest semiconductor company.[25] Avago Technologies agreed to sell LSI's Axxia Networking business to Intel for $650 million.[12][26] The company also agreed to buy PLX Technology, an integrated circuits designer, for $309 million.[27] In February 2015, it was announced that Avago Technologies Limited had reached an agreement to acquire Emulex Corporation for $8 per share in cash.[28]

Acquisition of and change of name to Broadcom Limited[edit]

On 28 May 2015, Avago announced that it would buy Broadcom Corporation[29] for $37 billion ($17 billion cash and $20 billion in shares).[30] The combined company, which would be named Broadcom Ltd., would have annual revenue of $15 billion and a market value of $77 billion.[31] Broadcom Corp. strengthened Avago Technologies' patent position significantly in sectors such as mobile, the data center, and the Internet of Things and made the company the ninth largest holder of patents among the top semiconductor vendors, according to an analysis by technology consulting firm LexInnova.[32] According to the company's website, the transaction closed on 1 February 2016.[33]

In May 2016, Cypress Semiconductor announced that it will acquire Broadcom Corporation's full portfolio of IoT products for $550 million. Under the deal, Cypress acquires Broadcom's IoT products and intellectual property for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Zigbee connectivity, as well as Broadcom's WICED platform and SDK for developers. The deal combined Broadcom's developer tools and connectivity technologies for IoT devices with Cypress' own programmable system-on-a-chip (SoC) products that provide memory, computing and graphics processing for low-power devices.[34]

Foreign investment reviews and change of name to Broadcom Inc.[edit]

In 2016, Broadcom proposed merging with Brocade Communications Systems. The acquisition proposal included a $5.5 billion price and was offered in cash.[35] It was delayed for review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. On 2 November 2017, Broadcom announced it would relocate its legal address from Singapore to Delaware, which would avoid the review.[36] This action was linked to the parent company being renamed from Broadcom Limited to Broadcom Inc.[37] The pre-2016-merger Broadcom, Broadcom Corporation, remains a wholly owned subsidiary of the renamed parent Broadcom Inc.

In mid-November 2017, Broadcom proposed to purchase Qualcomm for US$130 billion, which was rebuffed by Qualcomm's board.[38] The proposed hostile takeover, which was later revised to $117 billion, was blocked by the Trump administration by an executive order that cited national security concerns.[39][40][41][42] Specifically, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States expressed concerns. Broadcom, then headquartered in Singapore, was considered too close to China and chipmaker Huawei.[43][44] "A shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States," CFIUS said. "While the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover."[44] However, critics of the move stated that the decision was motivated by competitiveness more than security concerns.[40] Broadcom withdrew its takeover bid two days after the executive order.[42] Observers have stated that President Trump's decision was as consistent with the balance of trade objectives as it was with security concerns.[40]

Move into software[edit]

Historically a semiconductor-based-only company,[45] the failure of the Qualcomm bid led Broadcom and its CEO to look at acquiring infrastructure software as an alternative way of growing in size.[46] On 11 July 2018, news sources reported that Broadcom and CA Technologies agreed on terms for an $18.9 billion acquisition.[45] CA Technologies, formerly known as Computer Associates, was a longtime giant in software for mainframe computers that had expanded its offerings into software for cloud computing.[47] And on 5 November 2018, Broadcom announced that it had completed the acquisition of CA Technologies.[48]

On 9 August 2019, news sources reported that Broadcom had decided to acquire the enterprise security business of Symantec Corporation (the consumer software portion of which is now known as Gen Digital) for $10.7 billion in cash.[49] The deal continued Broadcom's push into software critical for corporate infrastructure.[46] And on 4 November 2019, Broadcom announced that it had completed the acquisition of the business, as well as the Symantec name and brand.[50][51][52][53][54]

In 2019, Broadcom was announced the fifth best performing stock of the 2010s, with a total return of 1,956%.[55]

Anti-competitive practices investigations[edit]

On January 17, 2018, it was reported that the FTC had been investigating Broadcom for several months in regard to its anti-competitive tactics while negotiating with customers.[56]

In October 2019, Broadcom was ordered by the European Union to stop allegedly anticompetitive practices.[7] In 2021, Broadcom agreed to settle an antitrust complaint which claimed it had abused its monopoly power through restrictive contract terms and threats of retaliation against non-compliant customers.[57] Such contract terms stifle innovation and harm competition in the global supply market.[58] European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that Broadcom's contract terms with six main customers would "create serious and irreversible harm to competition" if no action were taken.[59]

In 2021, Broadcom agreed to settle an antitrust complaint, in which the U.S. Federal Trade Commission claimed that the company abused its monopoly power using restrictive contract terms and threats of retaliation against customers the company deemed "disloyal."[57] The company faced a similar antitrust proceeding with the European Commission, which was settled after Broadcom committed to refrain from certain business practices. This included a commitment to suspend agreements containing exclusivity or quasi-exclusivity arrangements and a commitment not to enter into such agreements for seven years.[60]

Patent suits[edit]

In 2017, Broadcom filed patent suits against smart TV manufacturers. The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in favor of the smart TV manufacturers.[61]

In 2020, Broadcom sued Netflix over multiple patent infringements.[61] Critics have argued that Broadcom is suing Netflix for being more successful,[62] citing the declining number of traditional pay television subscribers due to the rise of streaming services.[63] The Leichtman Research Group calculated that the largest pay TV providers in the U.S. – representing about 95% of the market – lost about 4,915,000 net video subscribers in 2019.[63] Regular customers each pay $231 a year for their boxes, totaling almost $20 billion per year in profit for the cable industry.[62]

2020s[edit]

On January 7, 2020, Accenture PLC agreed to acquire Symantec's 300-person cybersecurity services division from Broadcom.[64] In February 2020, Broadcom announced the world's first WiFi 6E client device, the BCM4389.[65] In early 2020, Raspberry Pi inc revealed that their new boards would have a Broadcom BCM2711 chip.

In May 2022, Broadcom announced their deal to acquire the virtualization and cloud computing software vendor VMware for $61 billion in a combination of cash and stock, with Broadcom assuming $8 billion in VMware debt.[66][67][68][46] In November 2022, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority regulator announced it would investigate whether the Broadcom Inc. acquisition of VMware Inc. would "result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services".[69][70] The European Commission also said it was investigating the proposed acquisition, and as a result, Broadcom and VMware extended the planned completion date out to May 26, 2023.[71] On May 19, 2023, as both UK and EU regulators had yet to complete their investigations, the completion date was formally extended[72] to August 26, 2023, and was later further extended to as late as November 26, 2023.[73]

On November 21, 2023, Broadcom Inc. announced its plan to finalize the $69 billion acquisition of VMware Inc. on the following Wednesday. This acquisition, one of the largest in the technology sector, received global regulatory scrutiny, including from China, which approved the deal with specific conditions. These conditions require VMware's server software to be compatible with local hardware and not restrict customers from using Broadcom's hardware products. Despite concerns over rising China-U.S. tensions, the approval from China, which was the last regulatory hurdle, allowed the deal to proceed.[74] The transaction closed on November 22, 2023.[75] On completion, CEO Hock Tan announced that the company would relocate its headquarters in San Jose to the VMware campus in Palo Alto.[76][77] In February 2024, Broadcom sold the end-user computing division, which it inherited from the VMware acquisition, to KKR for $4 billion.[78]

Corporate affairs[edit]
Finances[edit]

For the fiscal year 2023, Broadcom reported earnings of US$14.1 billion, with an annual revenue of US$35.8 billion, an increase of 7.9% over the previous fiscal cycle.[79]

Broadcom's Billion-Dollar Blueprint: What Does Broadcom Actually Do & How AI And Silicon Are Propelling Its Meteoric Rise
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 4-7 minute read

###### Author: Tucker Massad

###### Published December 17, 2024

Broadcom's journey from a niche semiconductor player to a pivotal driver in today’s AI revolution is a story packed with innovation, strategic pivots, and some seriously impressive financials. With roots tracing back to 1961, Broadcom has transformed itself through mergers, acquisitions, and laser-focused product development to become an integral backbone of modern technology. Today, with a staggering market cap of $1.12 trillion following its blockbuster Q4 2024 earnings report, Broadcom has firmly planted itself in the tech stratosphere. Let's dissect this evolution and explore the flagship products that have catapulted Broadcom into the AI spotlight.

Broadcom's early days were marked by its focus on analog and digital semiconductor devices. Founded in 1961 as part of Hewlett-Packard's semiconductor business, Broadcom initially concentrated on products like LEDs, transistors, and signal processors. Fast-forward to 1999, when the company spun off as Avago Technologies, setting the stage for a series of acquisitions that would define its growth trajectory.

One of Broadcom’s most transformative moments came in 2016, when it acquired Broadcom Corporation for $37 billion and adopted its name. This acquisition wasn’t just a rebranding; it was a calculated move to dominate high-margin markets like networking, broadband, and enterprise storage. By the time the dust settled, Broadcom was a behemoth, ready to tackle the next frontier: AI.

[#](https://financhle.com/articles/what-does-broadcom-actually-do#modern-ai-products)Modern AI Products: The Backbone of Broadcom’s Valuation Boom
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Broadcom’s current product lineup reads like a who’s who of cutting-edge technology. Central to its AI narrative are its application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and custom silicon solutions. These products are designed to handle the data-intensive workloads demanded by AI and machine learning applications, making them indispensable in hyperscale data centers.

1.  ### ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits)
    
    Tailored for high-performance AI and machine learning tasks in hyperscale data centers.
    
2.  ### Tomahawk Ethernet Switches
    
    Enable ultra-high bandwidth and low latency for AI training clusters, relied on by cloud giants like AWS and Google Cloud.
    
3.  ### Jericho Routers
    
    Critical for AI workloads with complex networking needs in large-scale data centers.
    
4.  ### Broadcom’s NVMe Controllers
    
    Provide lightning-fast storage solutions essential for AI data processing and retrieval.
    

These products exemplify Broadcom’s strategy of dominating the infrastructure side of AI, the part that ensures data flows smoothly and efficiently.

Broadcom’s Q4 2024 earnings report revealed $45 billion in annual revenue—a 30% year-over-year increase—with a whopping 25% of that revenue directly tied to AI-related products. While the company’s market cap currently flirts with the $1.12 trillion mark, its valuation has critics asking whether such numbers are sustainable in a competitive market. However, there’s no denying Broadcom’s products are critical to the AI ecosystem.

Broadcom’s competitive advantage lies in its vertical integration, blending software and hardware to deliver custom solutions. This is a far cry from the off-the-shelf GPUs that companies like Nvidia dominate. While Nvidia’s GPUs handle raw AI processing power, Broadcom provides the connective tissue that ensures those GPUs function at peak efficiency within massive AI clusters. It’s like Nvidia built the Formula 1 engine, but Broadcom paved the racetrack, installed the pit stops, and provided the fuel.

[#](https://financhle.com/articles/what-does-broadcom-actually-do#gpu-comparison)Broadcom vs. Nvidia: The Battle of AI Strategies
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It’s easy to lump Broadcom in with Nvidia and AMD, but the reality is their business models and competitive edges differ dramatically. Nvidia is the poster child for GPUs, with its dominance in AI processing chips earning it household-name status among tech enthusiasts. Broadcom, on the other hand, focuses on the plumbing of AI—the networking chips, Ethernet switches, and ASICs that ensure GPUs can communicate and scale efficiently.

Think of it this way: Nvidia builds the high-performance sports car, while Broadcom lays down the racetrack, complete with precision-engineered curves and speed boosters. Without Broadcom’s infrastructure, Nvidia’s GPUs would be akin to Ferraris stuck in traffic.

Broadcom’s approach has its strengths. Unlike Nvidia’s reliance on consumer-facing products like gaming GPUs, Broadcom’s customer base is almost exclusively enterprise, hyperscalers, and cloud providers. This focus on large, predictable contracts offers stability but also exposes the company to concentrated risks should these customers scale back their spending.

[#](https://financhle.com/articles/what-does-broadcom-actually-do#valuation-growth)Valuation Growth: Riding the AI Wave
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Broadcom’s market cap has skyrocketed in recent years, now sitting at $1.12 trillion as of Dec 17, 2024. This is a company riding the crest of the AI wave, with its products deeply embedded in the infrastructure supporting this technological revolution.

The company’s recent earnings reveal both its strengths and vulnerabilities. While 25% of its revenue now comes from AI-related products, Broadcom has also diversified into areas like 5G infrastructure, broadband, and enterprise software. This diversification reduces risk, but the AI segment’s growth is clearly the engine driving the valuation.

So, is the valuation justified? That depends on your perspective. If AI adoption continues at its current breakneck speed, Broadcom’s products will remain indispensable. But the valuation also bakes in expectations of flawless execution, no small feat given potential regulatory hurdles and emerging competition.

[#](https://financhle.com/articles/what-does-broadcom-actually-do#broadcoms-next-chapter)Broadcom’s Next Chapter
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Looking ahead, Broadcom is doubling down on innovation. Its $5 billion annual R&D spend ensures it remains at the forefront of networking and AI hardware. New products aimed at edge computing and wireless connectivity could unlock additional growth avenues, cementing Broadcom’s status as a tech giant.

In summary, Broadcom is not just riding the AI wave—it’s helping to build the ocean. With strategic focus and a proven ability to innovate, the company is poised to remain a cornerstone of the tech landscape. But whether its valuation is sustainable will depend on how well it navigates the challenges ahead.

Title: Innovative Mainframe Solutions: A Deep Dive into Broadcom's Initiatives

URL Source: https://futurumgroup.com/insights/innovative-mainframe-solutions-a-deep-dive-into-broadcoms-initiatives/

Markdown Content:
This past week, Camberley Bates and I attended the Broadcom Mainframe Software Analyst forum, which offered an in-depth look at Broadcom’s strategic vision and initiatives in the mainframe space. The event featured over 30 executives, including Greg Lotko, Senior Vice President of Broadcom’s Mainframe Software Division, who reports directly to CEO Hock Tan. Lotko’s comments on investment and growth were particularly noteworthy, contrasting sharply with the uncertain market narrative around VMware. Key themes included Open, Hybrid, and Partnership, but the dominant takeaway was Broadcom’s unwavering focus on delivering customer value. This principle was evident throughout their presentations, responses to questions, and strategic explanations.

Broadcom’s approach can be summarized by its commitment to align business objectives with customer benefits. This philosophy was consistently reflected in their statements, such as:

*   “We will do what is of business value to us and our customers.”
*   “We made the decision based on feedback from customers.”

Examples of this customer-centric approach included several innovative programs:

1.  Win-No-Fee Service: Broadcom offers a service where they analyze and recommend tool consolidation, providing consulting services to manage the migration at no cost to the client. This program demonstrates their confidence in delivering tangible savings and efficiency improvements.
2.  Gen-AI Initiative: Broadcom aims to develop AI solutions in collaboration with customers, ensuring that both parties anticipate and validate the value. They focus on building and testing AI capabilities with clients’ data on their premises, fostering an innovation partnership.
3.  Mainframe Vitality Residency Program: This year-long initiative addresses the talent gap in the mainframe space. Broadcom hires, trains, and mentors new mainframe professionals, placing them with clients as interns, with the option for clients to hire them. Broadcom fully funded this program, highlighting their investment in the future of mainframe expertise.
4.  DevOps Enablement: Broadcom’s approach integrates modern and legacy tools, allowing traditional mainframers and modern programmers to collaborate seamlessly. This integration is crucial for enhancing productivity and fostering a culture of innovation within mainframe teams.
5.  Delivering functionality without cost: Broadcom has taken a novel approach to delivering new feature/function to its portfolio. Rather than looking to charge upgrades or create SKU’s and bundles, Broadcom has decided to focus on adoption rather than upsell. A great example of this is the new cloud-based functionality within CA-1.

Broadcom’s relentless focus on customer value is not just a strategic direction but a core operational principle. Their initiatives are tailored to meet the evolving needs of their clients, ensuring that both Broadcom and their customers achieve mutual success.

The Mainframe’s Relevance
-------------------------

Lotko emphasized that Broadcom is not only maintaining its investment in mainframe technologies but is actively growing this segment. This stands in stark contrast to the challenges faced by VMware, where strategic direction and investment have been more ambiguous in recent times. The mainframe, often perceived as a relic of the past, remains a cornerstone for over 3,000 global enterprises and governments. This platform is crucial for these organizations, handling vast amounts of transaction processing, especially in industries such as banking, insurance, and retail. Despite its age, the mainframe’s robustness, security, and reliability make it irreplaceable for mission-critical operations.

Skills and Investment: Addressing the Talent Gap
------------------------------------------------

A key focus of the forum was the evolving landscape of mainframe skills and Broadcom’s proactive steps to address the talent gap. [The 2024 Global Mainframe Skills Report by The Futurum Group](https://futurumgroup.com/research-reports/global-mainframe-skills-report-insights-from-industry-and-educational-experts/) offers invaluable insights into this area. Contrary to the pervasive narrative of an aging mainframe workforce, the report highlights a 65% increase in skilled mainframe professionals over the past five years. Furthermore, 91% of employers plan to hire new mainframe talent within the next two years, underscoring the ongoing demand for these skills.

Broadcom has recognized the critical need for a skilled workforce and has implemented several innovative programs to bridge the skills gap. One standout initiative is the Mainframe Vitality Residency Program. This year-long program recruits, trains, and mentors new mainframe professionals, placing them with clients as interns. Clients have the option to hire these interns, providing a seamless transition from training to full-time employment. This program is fully funded by Broadcom, demonstrating a significant investment in the future of mainframe expertise.

Another key program is Broadcom’s DevOps Enablement initiative, which integrates modern and legacy tools. This approach allows traditional mainframers and modern programmers to collaborate effectively, enhancing productivity and fostering innovation within mainframe teams. By providing tools that support both old and new methodologies, Broadcom is ensuring that the mainframe environment remains adaptable and attractive to new talent.

In addition to skills development, Broadcom is also driving value for clients through innovative solutions like Watchtower. This observability platform provides comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities for mainframe environments. It integrates with third-party tools such as Splunk and Datadog via OpenTelemetry APIs, allowing for a unified view of the IT landscape. Watchtower’s inclusion at no additional cost is a testament to Broadcom’s commitment to delivering value without imposing an extra financial burden on clients.

Broadcom’s strategy also includes delivering new functionalities without additional costs, focusing on adoption rather than upselling. A prime example is the new cloud-based functionality within CA-1, which enhances the existing toolset without requiring clients to purchase new licenses or upgrades. This approach drives value and encourages broader use of Broadcom’s solutions, ensuring that clients can fully leverage the capabilities of their mainframe environments.

Looking Ahead
-------------

Looking to the future, Broadcom’s investment strategy is clear: continue to deliver value and drive innovation in the mainframe space. This commitment is not just about maintaining the status quo but actively enhancing the capabilities and relevance of the mainframe in modern IT infrastructures. The Gen-AI initiative is a prime example, where Broadcom collaborates with clients to develop AI solutions tailored to their specific needs. By building and testing AI capabilities with clients’ data on their premises, Broadcom fosters a partnership that ensures the solutions are practical and valuable.

Broadcom’s focus on customer value is evident in every aspect of its strategy. From the Win-No-Fee Service, which offers tool consolidation and migration consulting at no cost, to the integration of modern development practices through DevOps Enablement, Broadcom is dedicated to aligning its business objectives with customer benefits. This customer-centric approach is not just a strategic direction but a core operational principle.

The ongoing investment in programs such as the Mainframe Vitality Residency and the Mainframe Expert Program highlights Broadcom’s dedication to addressing both immediate and long-term talent needs. By placing highly knowledgeable professionals within client organizations and offering extensive training and mentoring, Broadcom ensures that the mainframe workforce is not only skilled but also continuously improving.

In summary, the Broadcom Mainframe Software Analyst forum provided a comprehensive view of how Broadcom is positioning itself as a leader in the mainframe space. Through strategic investments, innovative programs, and a relentless focus on customer value, Broadcom is ensuring that the mainframe remains a vital and dynamic part of the modern enterprise IT landscape. The insights gained from this event underscore the importance of the mainframe and highlight Broadcom’s commitment to driving value and fostering innovation for its clients. As the mainframe continues to evolve, Broadcom’s strategic vision and customer-centric approach will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping the future of this critical technology.

Title: Broadcom Stock Price Analysis - Growth with AI Expansion and Strategic Acquisitions Driving New Offerings

URL Source: https://investdiva.com/broadcom-stock-price-analysis/

Published Time: 2024-11-22T18:13:36+00:00

Markdown Content:
[Broadcom](https://www.broadcom.com/) Stock Price Analysis. (AVGO) is a key player in modern connectivity, producing advanced chips for routers, Wi-Fi hubs, and data center equipment.

The company is also a significant contributor to AI technology, providing essential networking products like Ethernet switches that enable faster data movement, a critical component of AI infrastructure.

While [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/) often takes the spotlight for AI chips, Broadcom’s leadership in networking positions it as an indispensable part of the AI ecosystem.

Its growing role in AI complements its established semiconductor business and recent software expansion through acquisitions.

#### Broadcom YouTube Channel Overview

#### **1\. Strategic Acquisitions Boost Revenue Diversification**

Broadcom’s history of strategic acquisitions, including its recent $69 billion VMware deal, has played a critical role in diversifying its revenue streams.

This shift has reduced reliance on hardware and expanded its presence in the software market, balancing its income sources and providing stability.

Through its acquisitions, Broadcom has strengthened its ability to generate recurring revenue from software solutions, targeting new markets and enhancing overall resilience.

The VMware acquisition has also positioned the company for long-term growth by increasing software’s contribution to total revenue and reducing dependency on a concentrated customer base.

#### **2\. AI Expansion And Market Position**

Broadcom is actively tapping into the growing AI market. Although AI currently contributes a smaller share of the company’s revenue, its potential for future growth is significant. The company’s partnerships and focus on networking solutions uniquely position it to support large cloud providers preparing for AI-driven demand.

Broadcom’s AI segment is supported by its custom chips, which are designed to meet specific customer needs. Unlike competitors offering general-purpose chips, Broadcom’s tailored approach sets it apart in the industry, giving it a competitive advantage.

Additionally, nearly all Internet traffic passes through Broadcom’s technology, underscoring its pivotal role in both AI infrastructure and modern connectivity.

#### **3\. Financial Performance And Growth Outlook**

Broadcom has delivered strong financial results, driven by revenue and earnings growth, high profit margins, and robust free cash flow.

The company has also consistently increased its dividend, making it an attractive choice for long-term investors.

Despite challenges like high debt levels from recent acquisitions, Broadcom has demonstrated proactive measures to manage its financial obligations, including reducing high-interest debt.

With its clear long-term strategy, the company appears well-positioned for success in AI, software, and beyond.

#### **4\. Technical Chart Analysis**

Broadcom’s valuation is currently considered fair, and market sentiment remains bullish. Based on this, I plan to start buying at the current market price, followed by the following Buy Limit Order (BL) levels:

*   **$152.29**
*   **$144.29**
*   **$133.49**

These levels provide opportunities to capitalise on Broadcom’s growth while mitigating risk.

_Remember: Investing is personal, and what is right for me might not be right for you. Always do your own due diligence. You should ONLY invest based on your own risk tolerance and your timeframe for reaching your portfolio goals._

#### **5\. Broadcom Stock Price Analysis – Conclusion**

Broadcom is strategically positioned for growth, leveraging AI expansion and strategic acquisitions to diversify its offerings and revenue streams. Its focus on custom chip solutions, software integration, and essential AI infrastructure solidifies its strong market position.

The company’s proactive financial management and consistent dividend growth make it a compelling choice for investors seeking both stability and long-term potential.

PALO ALTO, Calif., Dec. 7, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Broadcom Inc. (Nasdaq: AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 29, 2023, provided guidance for its fiscal year 2024 and announced its quarterly dividend.

"Broadcom's fiscal year 2023 revenue grew 8% year-over-year to a record $35.8 billion, driven by investments in accelerators and network connectivity for AI by hyperscalers," said Hock Tan, President and CEO of Broadcom Inc. "The acquisition of VMware is transformational. In fiscal year 2024 we expect semiconductor to sustain its mid to high single digit revenue growth rate, with the contribution of VMware driving consolidated revenue to $50 billion, and adjusted EBITDA to $30 billion."

"In fiscal year 2023 we achieved record adjusted EBITDA margin of 65%, generating $17.6 billion in free cash flow or 49% of revenue, demonstrating our stable and diversified business model," said Kirsten Spears, CFO of Broadcom Inc. "With this transformational acquisition and expected increase in cash flows, we are increasing our quarterly common stock dividend by 14% to $5.25 per share for fiscal year 2024. The target fiscal 2024 annual common stock dividend of $21.00 per share is a record, and the thirteenth consecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in fiscal 2011."

Fiscal Year 2024 Business Outlook

Based on current business trends and conditions, the outlook for continuing operations for fiscal year 2024, ending November 3, 2024, including contributions from VMware, is expected to be as follows: 

Fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance of approximately $50.0 billion; and
Fiscal year 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance of approximately 60 percent of projected revenue.

The guidance provided above is only an estimate of what the Company believes is realizable as of the date of this release. The Company is not readily able to provide a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA to projected net income without unreasonable effort. Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material. The Company undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise any of these projections, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

Quarterly Dividends

The Company's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $5.25 per share. The dividend is payable on December 29, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on December 20, 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release. Broadcom believes non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Company's on-going performance. Therefore, Broadcom provides this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Company's on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. 

In addition to GAAP reporting, Broadcom provides investors with net income, operating income, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow and other data on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, non-GAAP tax reconciling adjustments, and other adjustments. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of the Company's underlying performance. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating the core operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their operations compare to the Company's operations, and benchmarking performance externally against the Company's competitors. The exclusion of these and other similar items from Broadcom's non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual.

Free cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Investors should not consider presentation of free cash flow measures as implying that stockholders have any right to such cash. Broadcom's free cash flow may not be calculated in a manner comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.

**Catalyst Partners now lead the go-to-market strategy and customer relationships for Symantec and Carbon Black**

PALO ALTO, Calif., Aug. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) today announced Catalyst, an extension of Broadcom’s [Accelerate](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=o9hkavxPSyg2kPmJZlVgeovquVFPLd8HBuIW4U1uE5h4s7NBWyrZtbyrrvFvNJgXg9SYpvQsQMEUOikLsgDkt1ArQFOh6-JN4QFlUrAISE4ad4wwOPzr2hM7zT86B2A-m0DPQdq0arScvNdw68GMPSxVOfC2IvKwQ_aSwuXiJdAHxLc_jDN9gp4x1Gckp7wfWe61ZRJptbnCn8aBKo473qUSh1PQhjRk1zCTbYvDpXs=) Program and a revolutionary global initiative that enlists elite [Enterprise Security Group](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=13g1oB1LcJFy5tzH3_iOK8HVXJBpiMsgzmMPs66nK_wkN7g1PB7MU5tusdeD4b1BmTIGCLHIHiiyonQvnpjdF3JdaeJx9PKe2dcbsLsofSSuRB584tg4UMK-i-sWxsKUXiQsRAfLBN9p5JGOGNxNhnl6mEv9V81KzWxSasHjVNIOTiTQXVPFRMSKYz-1t0K5AFSd9tZV8vqh-H4GitxIubyjA7BgGwTKrxuVYZ648wY=) (ESG) partners to lead the go-to-market and customer relationships for the Symantec and Carbon Black portfolios, with certain sole distribution relationships by region.

Inaugural Catalyst Partners include TD SYNNEX (Americas), Arrow Electronics (North, Central, and Southern Europe), MBCOM Technologies (Emerging Markets), Westcon-Comstor (Asia Pacific), and Carahsoft Technology Corp. (United States Federal Government, State, Local, and Education).

Backed by Broadcom’s product innovation and enablement tools, Catalyst unlocks each partner’s potential to drive significant profit growth while empowering elite, in-country technical experts to deliver value-added services and Tier 1 and Tier 2 support to the customers of these iconic security brands.

Broadcom will continue to provide the product management, marketing, sales operations support, and enablement tools designed to ensure the success and growth for Catalyst partners. In addition, Broadcom will provide advanced, Tier 3 customer support and additional engineering resources to ensure both partners and customers are fully benefiting from their investment in Broadcom’s ESG solutions.

“With the introduction of Catalyst, Broadcom is blazing a new path forward for channel partnerships in the cybersecurity industry,” said Rob Greer, Vice President and General Manager of the Enterprise Security Group at Broadcom. “Catalyst partners have a vested interest in the success and growth of the Symantec and Carbon Black portfolios and are also empowered to customize the go-to-market execution to meet the unique needs of their customers. As an engineering-first company, Broadcom will remain focused on developing the most advanced security solutions to help our customers solve the most complex security challenges.”

**Hear from the Catalyst Partners:**

“Symantec and Carbon Black are two leading security brands. Based on our success selling Symantec, we are tremendously excited to be able to sell Carbon Black. Historically the software vendor has been responsible for managing the channel sales business, and now we have the flexibility to localize programs and package offerings to best fit the needs of our shared customers. The Catalyst initiative further drives our ability to expand our presence in the SMB and mid-market,” said Eric Nowak, president of Arrow’s global enterprise computing solutions business.

“Federal, state and local governments continue to be top targets for today’s ransomware groups. Broadcom deeply understands the difficult security and regulatory challenges facing the public sector. With the launch of Catalyst, Carahsoft is further empowered to develop specific security strategies leveraging Symantec and Carbon Black that will significantly reduce the risk of ransomware and other cyberthreats,” said Brian Snell, Carahsoft Sales Director for the Broadcom Software Business.

“Although many of our customers face similar cyberthreats, from ransomware to nation-state attacks, their environments are unique and require experts with deep technical knowledge to manage the threats. MBCOM Technologies has been the sole regional partner for Broadcom in EMEA Emerging Markets for the past 4 years. Catalyst extends our partnership further by now allowing us to build solutions leveraging both the Symantec/Carbon Black brands and expand our presence in the region,” said Nehme Mouchantaf, VP at MBCOM Technologies.

“This new agreement with Broadcom represents a great opportunity to continue to empower our partners and meet them where they are in their buying journey,” said Mike Heintzelman, SVP, Vendor Solutions, TD SYNNEX. “Our team is extending our level of involvement through our expansive enablement resources and tools, demand generation efforts, and best-in-class technical support. It is our mission to be an accelerated extension of their team to ensure both ease and success for our partner community.”

“Westcon-Comstor became the aggregator partner for Broadcom’s Symantec cybersecurity portfolio in APAC several years ago, and since then our collaboration has expanded significantly in terms of both geographic reach and customer profile. We have harnessed our cybersecurity expertise, expansive channel reach and strong partner ecosystem in every key APAC market to onboard a wide range of cybersecurity partners for Symantec. Westcon-Comstor provides highly reliable customer support services to end users, and full enablement to our partners.

SAN JOSE, Calif., April 18, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [Broadcom Inc.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7rt3CA2yNjqc03wDKEckn8r8_l2LxO3CPEOw8PHPzkZRqqotLZRgfW84gJIlzRutacBmjuAP5yi1zW1RofuzOQ==) (NASDAQ:AVGO) announced today that it has delivered Jericho3-AI, enabling the industry’s highest performance fabric for artificial intelligence (AI) networks. Jericho3-AI revolutionizes AI networking with best-in-class capabilities such as perfect load balancing, congestion-free operation, ultra-high radix, and Zero-Impact Failover, all culminating in significantly shorter job completion times for any AI workload.

Jericho3-AI comes to market at a time when the use of AI is skyrocketing. According to [a new forecast](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=nvfnA4wsjncXb0WPVsmoj3HPfWPFnVkKUwskLOa2ClnbZ9tNFNWrdPZJvrfkErDwQUJaFRHc8S9D0-i6IfkCkz77Gla9claZ4a73UfHD8YktGC0l3V1WEBi5aeDqscVW) from International Data Corporation (IDC), global spending on AI will reach $154 billion in 2023 and $300 billion or more by 2026. The 2023 figure represents an increase of 26.9 percent over 2022.1

Fabrics based on Jericho3-AI will help network operators handle the ever-expanding workloads AI demands will present.

“The benchmark for AI networking is reducing the time and effort it takes to complete the training and inference of large-scale AI models,” said Ram Velaga, senior vice president and general manager, Core Switching Group, Broadcom. “Jericho3-AI delivers significant reduction in job completion time compared to any other alternative in the market.”

AI workloads have unique characteristics such as a low number of large, long-lived flows, all starting concurrently upon completion of an AI computation cycle. The Jericho3-AI fabric provides the highest performance for these workloads with unique functionality designed specifically for AI workloads:

*   **Perfect load balancing** equally sprays traffic over all links of the fabric, ensuring maximum network utilization under the highest network loads.
*   **Congestion-free operation** with end-to-end traffic scheduling ensures no flow collisions and no jitter.
*   **Ultra-high radix** uniquely allows the Jericho3-AI fabric to scale connectivity to 32,000 GPUs, each with 800Gbps, in a single cluster.
*   **Zero-Impact Failover** functionality ensures sub-10ns automatic path convergence, resulting in no impact to job completion time.

Leveraging this unique functionality, the Jericho3-AI fabric provides at least 10 percent shorter job completion times versus alternative networking solutions for key AI benchmarks such as All-to-All. This performance improvement has a multiplicative effect on decreasing the cost of running AI workloads since it implies that expensive AI accelerators are used 10 percent more efficiently. The network, in effect, pays for itself.

The Jericho3-AI fabric offers 26 petabits per second of Ethernet bandwidth, almost four times the bandwidth of the previous generation, while simultaneously delivering 40 percent lower power per gigabit.

“Cloud operators will upgrade their AI infrastructure to address the massive growth in bandwidth, driven by a new generation of high-capacity GPUs and the emergence of large language models,” said Bob Wheeler, principal analyst at Wheeler’s Network**.** “Jericho3-AI offers a high-bandwidth, low-latency and low-power choice for networks connecting tens of thousands of GPUs, revolutionizing the economics of building and maintaining AI clusters for this exciting new era.”

A unique feature of the Jericho3-AI fabric is that it provides the highest performance while also enabling the lowest total cost of ownership. This is achieved by virtue of attributes such as long-reach SerDes, distributed buffering, and advanced telemetry, all provided using industry-standard Ethernet. These factors provide a high degree of flexibility in network architectures and deployment options with the largest ecosystem of hardware and software providers.

Recently, Broadcom's performance report for fiscal year 2024, released on December 12, showcased the impressive strength of its AI technology and products, shocking the world.

Due to the market acceptance of Broadcom's ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit), shares of general-purpose computing chip company NVIDIA fell nearly 7%, hitting a new low since October 18 during intraday trading.

What exactly does Broadcom do?

Broadcom's business primarily covers two major areas: semiconductor technology and infrastructure software, demonstrating a robust diversification characteristic.

In fiscal year 2024, Broadcom's net income reached $51.6 billion, with a gross margin of 76.5%, highlighting remarkable profitability and operational efficiency.

Among them, the semiconductor business generated revenue of $30.1 billion, while the infrastructure software business generated revenue of $21.5 billion, a year-on-year increase of 196%. In the AI field, Broadcom's performance is particularly outstanding, with AI business revenue reaching $12.2 billion, a year-on-year increase of 220%, significantly increasing its share in the semiconductor business, fully demonstrating its competitive strength in the AI era.

Broadcom's overall technical strength includes network chip technology, AI custom chip technology, and interconnect technology. Like NVIDIA, Broadcom also has a unique software and ecosystem layout.

In the era of high-performance computing and AI, network chips are an important pillar of Broadcom's business.

As the world's largest network chip manufacturer, Broadcom's Ethernet product line provides various solutions for AI clusters. For example, the Tomahawk 5 Ethernet switch chip in the Endpoint Scheduled system architecture has achieved an 80-fold bandwidth increase since 2010—from 640 Gbps to 51.2 Tbps in 2022—while reducing energy consumption by over 90%, providing efficient support for data scheduling in small-scale AI clusters.

In the Switch Scheduled architecture, the Ramon and Jericho3 - AI chips enable multi-path interconnection, with Jericho3 - AI capable of connecting up to 32,000 GPUs, each AI accelerator card providing 800 Gbps of data bandwidth, effectively enhancing network performance.

Additionally, Broadcom's Thor series network cards are continuously innovating: Thor 2 is the industry's first 5nm process 400 Gigabit Ethernet NIC device, supporting 16 PCI Express 5.0 lanes, capable of directly driving 5-meter copper cables, and supporting RoCE v2 RDMA technology. Broadcom is also developing faster network card chips to continue leading the development of network chip technology.

In the field of AI custom chip technology, Broadcom is the world's largest AI custom chip service provider, holding about 70% of the $17.5 billion addressable market.

Since entering the customized AI accelerator market in 2014, Broadcom has collaborated closely with customers to develop multiple generations of XPU accelerators.

Broadcom plans to launch the next-generation XPU based on 3nm technology in the second half of 2025, accelerating the development of high-performance computing.

In terms of IP investment, Broadcom is highly forward-looking, having invested approximately $3 billion in the differentiation and innovation of XPU IP, with a broad IP portfolio that includes SerDes IP, AI-optimized NICs IP, cache IP, CPO IP software API, etc., providing critical support for XPU At the same time, Broadcom has also made significant breakthroughs in packaging technology. Its 3.5D eXtreme Dimension System-in-Package (XDSiP) platform technology integrates a large number of chips and HBM stacks, showing significant advantages in interconnection density and power efficiency, effectively enhancing the efficiency of large-scale AI computing and reducing power consumption.

Interconnection technology and related products are also areas of technological advantage for Broadcom.

For example, in the PCIe + Retimer technology, Broadcom has strong capabilities in the PCIe technology field.

What is PCIe?

PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) is a high-speed serial computer expansion bus standard used to connect a computer's motherboard to various peripheral devices.

Since the launch of the first generation of PCIe in 2003, Broadcom has shipped over 1 billion PCIe ports. In 2018, it introduced Retimer technology to solve long-distance signal transmission issues, which has since become a standard in the development of PCIe. In March 2024, Broadcom launched the world's first 5nm PCIe Gen 5.0/CXL2.0 and PCIe Gen 6.0/CXL3.1 retimer, providing important support for high-speed interconnection.

In the field of optical interconnection, Broadcom has long been a leader, especially in the achievements of optical interconnection technologies such as VCSEL and EML high-linearity continuous wave lasers. These technologies play a key role in high-speed interconnection for AI and ML systems, with speeds iterating up to 200Gbps.

Currently, Broadcom ships over 50 million high-speed optical communication lasers annually.

Broadcom has launched the industry's first 51.2Tbps CPO Ethernet switch, Bailly, which significantly reduces the operating power consumption of optical interconnections and improves silicon area efficiency compared to pluggable transceivers. Additionally, its 5nm Sian 2 and other products also possess robust electrical and optical interface capabilities.

Furthermore, the 5nm Peregrine and 3nm Condor SerDes technologies developed by Broadcom not only support copper cable connections but also natively support CPO, making them widely applicable across multiple product platforms. This technology has bandwidth capabilities exceeding 100GB, while the best domestic counterparts only offer 2GB of bandwidth.

Broadcom has also achieved remarkable results in infrastructure software, with its revenue accounting for as much as 41.6% of total revenue.

Through a series of strategic acquisitions, such as the acquisition of software giant VMware in 2023, Broadcom has built a relatively complete software business system, further strengthening its competitiveness in the semiconductor technology and infrastructure software markets, providing customers with more comprehensive solutions and forming an efficient collaborative network and software ecosystem.

However, to be fair, the completeness and ease of use of Broadcom's ASIC ecosystem are not as good as NVIDIA's CUDA. The software environment is relatively singular, mainly designed for specific purposes and algorithms, with a high programming difficulty. The development tools and software libraries are also not rich enough, requiring developers to spend more time debugging and developing, which limits its promotion in broader application scenarios Relatively speaking, NVIDIA's GPU products have a fast iteration speed, keeping up with technological development trends and market demands, with new products or performance improvements launched every year.

In contrast, Broadcom's ASIC chips, once designed and manufactured, are difficult to modify, with longer design and manufacturing cycles, making them less suitable for the rapidly changing AI market's frequent technological iterations, which may lead to a lag in technological advancement compared to NVIDIA.

The inability to make adjustments in technology and manufacturing as needed is the main reason why custom chips are more expensive than general-purpose chips.

Additionally, custom chips have another issue: a limited customer base.

Broadcom primarily focuses on providing custom chip services for large technology companies, resulting in a relatively narrow customer group; NVIDIA's GPU products are highly versatile, meeting the needs of businesses of various sizes and application scenarios, with a broad customer base ranging from small startups to large enterprises.

If a major customer that Broadcom relies on makes any technological shifts or business adjustments, Broadcom's performance will significantly suffer as a result.

From this perspective, NVIDIA has a greater advantage in market coverage and customer diversity, allowing it to better respond to market fluctuations and changes in customer demands.

The lack of a full-stack solution is also a shortcoming for Broadcom.

Broadcom mainly focuses on chip design and packaging, lacking a full-stack solution like NVIDIA: customers using Broadcom chips need to solve issues related to network devices, software, and other supporting facilities on their own, increasing the cost and complexity of use for customers.

Perhaps the market has fully recognized Broadcom's shortcomings when facing NVIDIA, which is why after the release of the fiscal year 2024 performance report on December 12, NVIDIA regained its "lost ground" in stock price, slightly rising by 1.70% overall by the close of U.S. stocks on December 23; meanwhile, Broadcom's stock price fell 6.84% from its peak on December 14 to $232.5 on December 23, but its total market value remains above $1 trillion, at $1.09 trillion.

In terms of future prospects, Broadcom is not only a leader in the semiconductor industry but also a key force driving the development of AI technology.

From network connectivity to AI computing power, from semiconductor hardware to software infrastructure, Broadcom's technological puzzle is complete and powerful, providing a solid foundation for the development of the AI industry.

Of course, Broadcom also faces numerous challenges, such as increasingly fierce market competition, requiring continuous investment in research and development to maintain its technological leadership; at the same time, the rapid development of AI technology necessitates that Broadcom continues to innovate to adapt to the ever-changing market demands

Moreover, the rivalry between Broadcom and Nvidia could lead to significant economic shifts, impacting stock valuations and market capitalizations. This environment of intensified competition is likely to spur innovation, driving the development of more efficient and powerful AI systems.

As AI hardware becomes more advanced, there may be a noticeable reduction in costs, making AI technologies increasingly accessible. This democratization could foster widespread AI adoption, influencing various sectors and promoting a more research-intensive AI ecosystem.

The strategic developments in AI hardware will have far-reaching implications, including geopolitical influences in the semiconductor industry. Nations may prioritize semiconductor manufacturing capabilities to secure technological sovereignty and maintain competitive advantages.

Additionally, as companies experiment with specialized AI hardware, there is a corresponding demand for new expertise in chip design and AI optimization, potentially reshaping job markets and educational focus areas.

Ultimately, the disruption in the AI hardware market will present both challenges and opportunities. Companies must navigate these complexities with strategic foresight, leveraging innovation and collaboration to sustain growth in the dynamic AI landscape.

[December 24, 2024](https://wallstreetpit.com/date/2024/12/) [Yoel Beinart](https://wallstreetpit.com/author/yoel-beinart/)

The landscape of the AI chip market is witnessing a significant shift as investors increasingly view **Broadcom Inc. (AVGO)** as a formidable alternative to **Nvidia (NVDA)** in the coming years. This perspective is gaining traction among analysts and fund managers who see Broadcom’s strategic positioning and financial performance setting the stage for a potential outperformance in 2025.

Broadcom’s competitive edge in the AI sector is largely attributed to the rising demand for Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), where it excels with its custom-designed chips. _Jefferies_ has pointed out Broadcom as its [top pick](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/buy-this-ai-chip-stock-for-2025-jefferies-told-its-clients-3784914) for 2025, elevating its price target from $225 to $300, based on the company’s robust growth in the AI chip market. This optimism stems from Broadcom’s ability to cater to the nuanced needs of tech giants, offering tailored solutions that align with specific AI applications.

The diversification of chip suppliers by major tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Meta (META) is playing to Broadcom’s advantage, [according](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-boom-broadcom-targets-nvidias-150815186.html) to Stephen Yiu, portfolio manager of the _Blue Whale Growth Fund_. Yiu, who expects “_Broadcom to be the next Nvidia in terms of outperformance potential_,” notes that while these companies continue to purchase Nvidia’s GPUs, they are also investing in their own custom silicon, reducing dependency on Nvidia and potentially boosting Broadcom’s market share. This strategy aligns with a broader industry trend where cost-effectiveness and customization are increasingly valued, especially as AI applications expand.

Financially, Broadcom has shown remarkable growth, with its AI revenue [jumping](https://wallstreetpit.com/121614-ai-gold-rush-broadcoms-hock-tan-sees-spending-surge-through-2030/) to $12.2 billion, a tripling from the previous year. This growth is not just in revenue but in market positioning, allowing analysts to forecast a significant rise in earnings per share if Broadcom continues to penetrate the premium AI market.

Analyst [sentiment](https://www.investopedia.com/will-broadcom-stock-have-its-nvidia-moment-in-2025-8762806) points to a bullish outlook for Broadcom. Bernstein has given the stock an ‘outperform’ rating with a $250 price target, while Morgan Stanley (MS) highlights it as one of the most promising AI semiconductor plays for the future. Similarly, Bank of America (BAC), just like _Jefferies_, has named Broadcom as its top semiconductor pick for 2025, recognizing it as an “AI leader” alongside industry giants like Nvidia and Marvell Technology (MRVL). The consensus among these analysts is clear; they believe Broadcom could follow in Nvidia’s footsteps, leveraging its current momentum to achieve substantial growth.

In conclusion, Broadcom’s strategic partnerships, coupled with its financial achievements and the growing demand for custom AI chips, position it as an attractive investment option for those looking to diversify their tech portfolio beyond Nvidia in 2025. The company’s trajectory indicates not only a challenge to Nvidia’s dominance but also an opportunity for investors to engage with a firm that’s at the forefront of the next wave of AI chip innovation.

Broadcom's connectivity solutions are driving its AI buzz.

**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/avgo/) 3.15%) is a popular pick in the artificial intelligence (AI) investing world. However, it's not as clear-cut as investing in **Nvidia** or **Palantir**, as both of these companies derive a significant chunk of their revenue through AI offerings.

Broadcom's product line has a far broader reach, which makes it a more diversified investment. However, diversification can also cause a company to miss out on some massive tech movements. So, is Broadcom a great AI pick? Or is its product line too widespread to benefit from this generational shift?

A non-AI division is behind Broadcom's growth
---------------------------------------------

If you look at Broadcom's product page on its website, you may get overwhelmed by the sheer number of choices it presents. It offers both hardware and software, such as cybersecurity and mainframe software, as well as connectivity products. Its biggest software product came as an acquisition when it purchased VMware.

VMware provides its clients with virtual desktop services via the cloud and doesn't have much to do with AI, even if it is a useful service. VMware is also a major reason Broadcom is showing revenue growth.

In third-quarter fiscal year 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom's revenue grew 47% year over year to $13 billion. However, when VMware's contribution is taken out (because VMware's results weren't included in Q3 FY 2023's results), Broadcom's revenue only rose 4% year over year.

For a company being portrayed as a strong AI investment, that's pretty weak growth, considering that other AI-centric investments are growing very quickly.

However, when you dig deeper, you'll find Broadcom's AI products crushing it.

The price tag on Broadcom's stock may be too much to pay
--------------------------------------------------------

Broadcom's biggest AI products are its connectivity switches and the custom accelerators that Broadcom helped design, like **Alphabet**'s tensor processing unit (TPU). Custom accelerators grew 350% year over year in Q3, and ethernet switching devices (which are used in servers to direct information flow) were up 400% year over year.

That's impressive growth for those two product lines, but the positive effect is drowned out by other Broadcom business segments that aren't doing as well.

Still, Wall Street expects Broadcom's growth to pick up in FY 2025, with 37 analysts projecting an average of 17.5% revenue growth. They clearly see these AI tailwinds having a greater effect next year, but does that make the stock a buy now?

Broadcom's stock isn't cheap. It fetches a pretty [hefty premium at nearly 38 times forward earnings.](https://www.fool.com/terms/f/forward-pe/ "What Is Forward P/E?")

[![Image 16: AVGO PE Ratio (Forward) Chart](https://media.ycharts.com/charts/ea1e75ff0a2fc0e95a1b041bb4ae23b8.png)](https://ycharts.com/companies/AVGO/chart/)

[AVGO PE Ratio (Forward)](https://ycharts.com/companies/AVGO/forward_pe_ratio) data by [YCharts.](https://ycharts.com/)

Those are pretty high expectations, and so far, Broadcom hasn't met them if you strip out VMware's effect.

Broadcom is a great company with excellent products. However, because it has so many product lines, it's difficult to see the effect AI is having on the business. The market seems to believe that investors will see this effect in 2025, but that seems to be a lofty expectation, considering that AI tailwinds have been around for about a year and a half.

I think investors can pick far better AI stocks than Broadcom, as [many of them are growing faster and trade for a far cheaper price](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/14/my-4-best-stocks-to-buy-right-now/ " My 4 Best Stocks to Buy Right Now") tag than Broadcom (like Alphabet or **Meta Platforms**). Broadcom may prove me wrong, but I'm not willing to take the risk, considering the price tag at which its stock is trading.

Price as of December 24, 2024, 1:00 p.m. ET

Up until the market opened on Friday, Dec. 13, America was home to seven technology companies worth $1 trillion or more:

1.  **Apple:** $3.7 trillion.
2.  **Nvidia:** $3.3 trillion.
3.  **Microsoft:** $3.3 trillion.
4.  **Amazon:** $2.4 trillion.
5.  **Alphabet:** $2.3 trillion.
6.  **Meta Platforms:** $$1.5 trillion.
7.  **Tesla:** $1.4 trillion.

However, an eighth company just joined the ranks. **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/avgo/) 3.15%) stock surged 24% last Friday following the release of its financial results for fiscal 2024 (ended Nov. 3), catapulting the company into the exclusive $1 trillion club.

Investors were impressed with Broadcom's soaring artificial intelligence (AI) revenue, which comes from selling custom chips and networking equipment for data centers. Plus, the company issued a very bullish forecast for its future AI revenue, which points to substantial potential growth ahead.

However, before you rush to buy Broadcom stock, you'll have to get comfortable with its lofty valuation. Here's what you need to know.

Broadcom is becoming a serious player in AI hardware
----------------------------------------------------

Broadcom was solely a supplier of semiconductors and electronics components for a variety of computing applications up until 2016, when it merged with fellow chip giant Avago Technologies. From there, the new-look Broadcom went on to spend around $100 billion acquiring other companies like semiconductor equipment supplier CA Technologies, cybersecurity vendor Symantec, and [cloud](https://www.fool.com/terms/c/cloud-computing/) software titan VMware.

Those companies helped Broadcom diversify its business, and they are now important contributors to the company's overall revenue. In other words, they paved the way for it to become the $1 trillion giant it is today. But thanks to the spending boom on [AI](https://www.fool.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence/) infrastructure from some of the world's leading tech giants, investors are currently laser-focused on Broadcom's semiconductor and networking businesses.

The company makes custom AI accelerators (a type of data center chip) for three hyperscale customers, and while their identities are not disclosed, hyperscalers typically include Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and **Oracle**. During Broadcom's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, it said shipments of AI accelerators _doubled_ compared to the year-ago period.

Here's why that's important. Nvidia's graphics processing units ([GPU](https://www.fool.com/terms/g/gpu/)s) for the data center are currently the most sought after chips in the AI industry. While each of the above hyperscalers are Nvidia customers, Broadcom gives them the ability to design their own chips, which means they can tailor their infrastructure to their own specific needs -- not to mention significantly reduce costs (Nvidia's hardware is very expensive).

Additionally, the company said its AI connectivity revenue soared fourfold thanks to sales of its Tomahawk and Jericho data center switches. Those devices regulate how quickly data travels between chips and devices, and since AI developers often use tens of thousands of chips to train their models, faster processing can lead to substantial cost savings.

AI revenue surged during fiscal 2024
------------------------------------

Broadcom generated a record $51.5 billion in total [revenue](https://www.fool.com/terms/r/revenue/) during the whole of fiscal 2024, which was a 44% increase from fiscal 2023. However, the majority of that growth was attributable to the inclusion of VMware's revenue for the first time, rather than organic growth (Broadcom acquired the company in 2023).

Nevertheless, Broadcom managed to impress investors with its AI revenue, which surged by a whopping 220% to $12.2 billion in fiscal 2024. Most of that came from sales of the AI accelerators and networking equipment discussed earlier, and the company expects to carry its strong momentum into fiscal 2025.

Broadcom's overall revenue growth came with a substantial increase in costs, which were partly attributable to the company's acquisitions (namely of VMware). [Research and development](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/what-to-invest-in/research-and-development/) spending, for example, increased by 78% year over year to $9.3 billion, which was the largest of the company's $19 billion in total [operating expenses](https://www.fool.com/terms/o/operating-expenses/) in fiscal 2024.

As a result, Broadcom's fiscal 2024 [net income](https://www.fool.com/terms/n/net-income/) (profit) of $5.9 billion actually represented a decrease of 58% from fiscal 2023. That significantly impacts the valuation of Broadcom stock for any investor valuing it based on its [GAAP](https://www.fool.com/terms/g/generally-accepted-accounting-principles/) earnings, which I'll discuss further in a moment.

On a [non-GAAP](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/gaap-vs-non-gaap/) basis, which excludes one-off expenses from acquisitions and non-cash costs like [stock-based compensation](https://www.fool.com/terms/s/stock-based-compensation/), Broadcom's net income came in at $23.7 billion, which was actually a 28% _increase_ from fiscal 2023. That gives investors a clearer idea of the trajectory of Broadcom's business.

Broadcom stock looks expensive right now
----------------------------------------

Broadcom generated GAAP [earnings per share](https://www.fool.com/terms/e/earnings-per-share/) (EPS) of $1.23 during fiscal 2024, so its stock trades at a [price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio](https://www.fool.com/terms/p/pe-ratio/) of 183. That's an eye-popping number considering the **Nasdaq-100** technology index trades at a P/E ratio of just 35.

Based on its non-GAAP EPS of $4.96, its P/E ratio is 45. While significantly better, it's still a big number relative to the broader tech sector. Plus, many investors don't consider non-GAAP EPS to be "true" profitability, so it isn't a good idea to hang your hat on that number to make the argument that Broadcom stock looks attractive.

Rather than using the traditional P/E ratio, we could value Broadcom using the [price-to-sales (P/S) ratio](https://www.fool.com/terms/p/price-to-sales-ratio-value-stocks/) instead, which divides a company's market capitalization by its annual revenue. Broadcom's P/S ratio is currently 20.7, which is almost _triple_ its 10-year average of 7.4:

[![Image 19: AVGO PS Ratio Chart](https://media.ycharts.com/charts/ed262ae3789ddde67846a52adc268cc4.png)](https://ycharts.com/companies/AVGO/chart/)

[AVGO PS Ratio](https://ycharts.com/companies/AVGO/ps_ratio) data by [YCharts](https://ycharts.com/)

In other words, Broadcom stock looks very expensive based on two measures of its P/E ratio, and also its P/S ratio. Therefore, buying the stock right now probably isn't a great idea for short-term investors with a time horizon of 12 months.

However, there might be a compelling case to buy it for long-term investors who are willing to hold the stock for the next three years or more. That's because Broadcom thinks it can grow its AI revenue to between $60 billion and $90 billion annually by fiscal 2027, thanks to soaring demand for accelerators and networking equipment.

Remember, its AI revenue came in at just $12.2 billion in fiscal 2024, so we're talking about a whopping 514% increase over the next three years (at the midpoint of the range).

I still think investors should wait for a pullback before buying Broadcom stock given its current valuation, but it's certainly a very high-quality way to play the AI boom.

Current Price

Price as of December 24, 2024, 1:00 p.m. ET

The tech giant's market cap just rose by more than $200 billion in a single day.

**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/nvda/) 0.39%)led the semiconductor industry and the tech sector to new heights in 2023 and 2024. The chipmaker embodied the breakneck pace of growth in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, and has been trading the crown of most valuable company in the world with **Apple** and **Microsoft**. But it is far from the only chip stock that is putting up monster gains.

After reporting its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter (ended Nov. 3) results on Dec. 12, **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/avgo/) 3.15%) surged by 24.4% on Dec. 13 to a new all-time high and a market cap of $1.05 trillion. The stock has more than doubled year-to-date and is now up by more than 600% during the past five years. In fact, Nvidia is up just 1% during the past six months, while Broadcom has surged by about 44% (as of Dec. 16).

Here's what you need to know about the tech giant's results, where it could be headed, and if this [growth stock](https://www.fool.com/terms/g/growth-stock/) is worth buying before 2025.

A primer on Broadcom
--------------------

Broadcom is in the [business of global connectivity](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/08/buy-nvidia-broadcom-chip-growth-stock-september/). It provides hardware and software solutions for cloud infrastructure, data centers, networking, broadband, wireless, storage, industrial applications, enterprise software, and more.

The company makes equipment for [advanced ethernet switching](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/11/29/is-broadcom-stock-a-buy/), which it believes will be in higher demand from hyperscalers like **Amazon** Web Services. Another big opportunity for Broadcom is application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for data centers. It has a majority share of the ASIC market, which could see [surging demand](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/12/10/prediction-this-ai-chip-stock-will-soar-soon/) as businesses look for lower-cost alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs.

Broadcom is unique because it has an integrated portfolio of products across the data center value chain, including network, server, and storage connectivity. It's thus a catch-all way to play the need for increased connectivity and AI.

Blowout results
---------------

The rises of cloud computing, infrastructure, and AI have transformed Broadcom from a value-focused company to a [high-octane growth stock](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/12/13/broadcom-ceo-just-delivered-fantastic-news-for-ai/). Its market cap surged due to increased demand from these industries.

The following chart shows the company's margin expansion and its revenue growth, which is up nearly eightfold during the past decade and a whopping 44% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. The recent narrowing in margins is largely due to the adjustments related to Broadcom's purchase of VMware and because it is investing heavily in innovation, not due to price sensitivity.

[![Image 16: AVGO Operating Margin (TTM) Chart](https://media.ycharts.com/charts/1caf11f7ec679f3f4e3aea5ec5fa018f.png)](https://ycharts.com/companies/AVGO/chart/)

[AVGO Operating Margin (TTM)](https://ycharts.com/companies/AVGO/operating_margin_ttm) data by [YCharts.](https://ycharts.com/)

Management sees the momentum carrying forward into fiscal 2025, forecasting first-quarter revenue of $14.6 billion and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ([EBITDA](https://www.fool.com/terms/e/ebitda/#:~:text=The%20acronym%20EBITDA%20stands%20for,judging%20a%20company's%20operating%20performance.)) of $9.64 billion. If it hits those targets, its revenue would increase by 22% year over year and adjusted EBITDA by 35%. Since the acquisition of VMWare somewhat inflated Broadcom's fiscal 2024 results, its fiscal 2025 growth will provide a more accurate reading of the company's post-acquisition growth rate.

Broadcom's transformation
-------------------------

Broadcom closed on its blockbuster purchase of VMware in early fiscal 2024. The deal boosted its position in software, cloud, and data centers, but there were questions about how fast it could integrate the organization. On the recent earnings call, management said that the integration of VMware was largely complete, and it is ahead of schedule on its sales and earnings growth. Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan attributed the integration of VMware and AI growth as the two significant drivers of Broadcom's transformations in fiscal 2024:

> Our AI revenue, which came from strength in custom AI accelerators or XPUs and networking, grew 220% from $3.8 billion in fiscal 2023 to $12.2 billion in fiscal 2024, and represented 41% of our semiconductor revenue. This drove semiconductor revenue up to a record $30.1 billion during the year.

AI has emerged as a key driver of semiconductor revenue, now Broadcom's largest segment by revenue, with momentum continuing in the near term. But that news alone likely wouldn't have resulted in the more than $200 billion pop in Broadcom's market cap in a single session. That pop more likely came because of management's three-year forecast.

Broadcom sees its three big hyperscale customers developing their own customer AI accelerators or XPUs over a multiyear period to represent a serviceable addressable market of $60 billion to $90 billion by fiscal 2027. Broadcom expects to dominate that market, and anticipates that its AI-driven semiconductor business will eclipse its non-AI semiconductor business in the near future. If it meets its targets, it would be the equivalent of Apple releasing a new product that became bigger than the iPhone in just five years.

Expectations are high
---------------------

Not long ago, it was easier to value Broadcom based on its trailing earnings and its growing dividend (which it just raised by 11%). But given how much the business has changed in a short amount of time, it is entering a new territory -- valuation expansion.

Valuation expansion occurs when investors are optimistic about a company's growth and are willing to value it based more upon its expected future earnings than on those of its recent past. Analysts' average expectations are for Broadcom's earnings to soar in the coming year, so the stock only sports a [forward price-to-earnings ratio](https://www.fool.com/terms/f/forward-pe/) of 36. That's surprisingly cheap for a stock that doubled during the past year and is up more than sevenfold in the past five years. But projections can differ from results, especially in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry.

Broadcom's valuation is being put to the test
---------------------------------------------

The investment thesis for Broadcom used to be that it was an established network connectivity business that was well-positioned to monetize AI. But in just one year, the company caught Wall Street off-guard by essentially stating that the AI-related semiconductor segment will become its largest. This fundamental change is reminiscent of the evolution of Nvidia -- its graphics segment used to be bigger than its data center business, but now, the data center business [accounts for 85% of revenue.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/12/08/dow-growth-stocks-nvidia-amazon-buy-2025/)

Broadcom remains an excellent buy if you believe in management's vision for capturing hyperscaler spending on AI. If it comes even close to its medium-term targets, future investors will likely be looking back on the current share price as a good value.

However, the stock could also sell off big time if an industrywide downturn occurs or if its forecasts are too optimistic. After all, management warned that the ramp-up in hyperscaler investment will not be linear, with outlays potentially varying widely from quarter to quarter.

Therefore, investors should take care to weigh the risks and potential rewards before jumping into Broadcom after its recent run-up. Some may want to wait and see how the hyperscalers' infrastructure ramp-up plays out. Today, the stock is priced for results that are close to perfection, but if there are hiccups along the way, it could come down to a more attractive valuation.

AI infrastructure growth
------------------------

Since the start of the AI boom, Nvidia has been the biggest winner. As the maker of [graphics processing units (GPUs)](https://www.fool.com/terms/g/gpu/) the company's chips became the backbone of AI infrastructure. Training [large language models](https://www.fool.com/terms/l/large-language-models/) (LLMs) and running [AI inference](https://www.fool.com/terms/a/ai-inference/) take a lot of computing power, and GPUs have proven to be the best chips for these tasks as they are able to perform many calculations at the same time in what is called parallel processing.

Nvidia, meanwhile, became the market leader in GPUs due to its CUDA software platform. The company originally developed the free software to allow developers to program its chips for tasks beyond speeding up the graphics rendering in things like video games, the job for which they were initially created, in order to sell more chips. As a result, CUDA became the program on which developers learned to train GPUs, which is what has helped create the large moat the company sees today. It currently has about a 90% market share in GPUs as a result.

The combination of its powerful GPUs and wide moat due to CUDA led the company to see astronomical growth as large tech companies race to develop more powerful AI models. Through the first nine months of its fiscal 2025 ending in January 2025, Nvidia's revenue surged 135% to $91.2 billion, while last quarter its revenue soared 94% to $35.1 billion.

With AI models needing exponentially more computing power as they become more advanced, Nvidia's future growth prospects also look promising. In fact, recent iterations of **Alphabet**'s Llama AI model and xAI's Grok model are being trained using up to 10 times as many GPUs as their predecessors. At the same time, Nvidia's hyperscale customers (those that own huge data centers) have indicated they plan to increase their spending on AI infrastructure next year as they see AI as a generational opportunity. For their part, analysts are projecting the company will grow its revenue by just over 50% next year.

![Image 20: Artist rendering of AI chip.](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F801205%2Fgettyimages-1402452876.jpg&op=resize&w=700)Image source: Getty Images.

While Nvidia is dominating the AI chip space, Broadcom is making inroads by helping customers develop custom AI chips. Its application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, are designed specifically for a customer's precise needs and can help with improved performance and more efficient power consumption.

Alphabet was the first company to use Broadcom's technology and expertise to develop its own custom AI chip. The result is a tensor-processing unit (TPU) called Trillium designed specifically to work within Google's TensorFlow (a software library for AI and machine learning). Alphabet said these TPUs have several features, such as a matrix multiply unit (MXU) and proprietary interconnect topology, that differentiate them from mass-merchant GPUs and make them ideal for accelerating AI training and inference.

While there were some reports that Alphabet was looking to just go on its own without Broadcom's help, Broadcom won the design contract for the next generation of Alphabet's TPUs. Meanwhile, the company gained four more custom AI chip customers. **Meta Platforms** and TikTok owner ByteDance are widely believed to be the company's established customers, while OpenAI and more recently **Apple** are thought to be recent customer wins.

On its latest earnings call, Broadcom said its three largest custom AI chip customers had an addressable market of between $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone and that they were planning on deploying 1 million of its custom AI chips by 2027. Meanwhile, it said its two newer AI chip customers could add to that total. As a reference, it took Alphabet 15 months to have its custom TPUs designed and deployed within its data centers.

While the AI opportunity for Broadcom is large, there is a big difference between an addressable market and expected revenue. The company is also involved in a lot of semiconductor and software businesses outside of AI, which aren't growing as quickly. The company grew organic revenue just 11% last quarter when excluding its acquisition of VMware, and analysts are currently looking for the company to increase its revenue by 18% this fiscal year, ending Oct. 31, 2025, and 14% the year after.

Valuation and verdict
---------------------

Nvidia currently trades at a cheaper valuation than Broadcom with a [forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio](https://www.fool.com/terms/f/forward-pe/) of about 30 compared to over 33 for Broadcom. Meanwhile, Nvidia is currently growing its revenue much faster, which is expected to continue in 2025. In addition, Nvidia holds about $30 billion in net cash, while Broadcom has $48.3 billion in net debt.

[![Image 22: NVDA PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart](https://media.ycharts.com/charts/9415ff63bfa57e90f4443a7b63b1bbe9.png)](https://ycharts.com/companies/NVDA/chart/)

[NVDA PE Ratio (Forward 1y)](https://ycharts.com/companies/NVDA/forward_pe_ratio_1y) data by [YCharts.](https://ycharts.com/)

Broadcom created a lot of hype with its comments on its AI addressable market, which have powered its stock price in December. Meanwhile, Nvidia's stock struggled to close out the year. But while Broadcom grabbed the momentum, Nvidia is now the cheaper stock and it's still expected to grow its revenue much more quickly in the near term.

Broadcom management has certainly put some doubt in investors' minds when it comes to who will be the big AI chip winner in the coming years. But Broadcom's gains won't necessarily come at Nvidia's expense. GPUs still have more versatility than custom chips and are still considered the standard. However, companies also want an option other than Nvidia to make sure it doesn't become too powerful.

I think both stocks have the potential to be winners in 2025, but I prefer Nvidia at this point given its current superior growth and cheaper valuation.

AVGO

\-

On Monday, UBS has increased the price target for Broadcom Limited (NASDAQ:[AVGO](https://www.investing.com/equities/avago-technologies)) shares to $270.00, up from the previous target of $220.00, while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. According to [InvestingPro](https://www.investing.com/pro/AVGO) data, Broadcom, now valued at over $1 trillion, is trading above its Fair Value, with 20 analysts recently revising their earnings estimates upward.

The company has demonstrated remarkable momentum, delivering a nearly 100% return year-to-date. The revision follows a thorough analysis of Broadcom's Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) disclosures and a reassessment of the potential for its custom compute and artificial intelligence (AI) networking businesses.

The firm's analyst has adjusted the AI revenue forecasts for the fiscal years 2026 and 2027, expecting approximately 20% and 40% increases, respectively. This optimistic adjustment is based on conservative market share assumptions and the anticipation of significant SAM growth as Broadcom potentially secures two additional hyperscaler clients for its AI services. The company's strong growth trajectory is already evident in its impressive 44% revenue growth over the last twelve months.

The analyst's statement highlighted the conservative nature of the market share assumptions and the potential for material SAM expansion, which could drive revenues higher if Broadcom adds more hyperscaler customers. The revised estimates reflect a more bullish outlook on Broadcom's AI revenue streams, prompting the increase in the price target to $270.

Broadcom's stock price target adjustment by UBS suggests confidence in the company's growth trajectory, especially in its AI networking and custom compute segments. The company's ongoing efforts to broaden its customer base, especially within the hyperscaler segment, are expected to contribute significantly to its revenue growth.

Broadcom Limited, a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, is poised to benefit from the growing demand for AI capabilities across various industries. The raised price target from UBS signals a positive outlook for the company's financial performance in the coming years.

With an excellent Financial Health Score on [InvestingPro](https://www.investing.com/pro/AVGO), strong profit margins of 75%, and consistent dividend growth, Broadcom demonstrates solid fundamentals. Investors can access detailed analysis and 18 additional ProTips about Broadcom through InvestingPro's comprehensive research reports.

In other recent news, Broadcom Limited has reported significant developments in its financial performance and growth prospects. Analyst firms Bernstein SocGen Group, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs all maintained positive ratings on Broadcom, citing the company's robust growth in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. Broadcom's fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 earnings showed revenues of $14.1 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.42. The company's semiconductor revenues of $8.2 billion exceeded expectations, largely driven by stronger AI revenue. However, the software segment underperformed, reporting $5.8 billion in revenue.

Broadcom anticipates revenues of $14.6 billion and an EBITDA margin of approximately 66% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. The company also projects an implied EPS of $1.51. The company's AI revenues for the fiscal year 2024 reached $12.2 billion, representing a threefold year-over-year increase. Broadcom's AI revenues are projected to grow to $17-18 billion in fiscal year 2025, marking a 40% year-over-year rise.

Broadcom's AI semiconductor serviceable available market (SAM) forecast for fiscal year 2027 is projected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion. This forecast is based on specific projects with its three leading AI Custom Compute customers, suggesting a sharper growth trajectory than earlier estimates.

The company also anticipates a significant ramp-up in XPU ASICs in the second half of 2025, thanks to new 3nm products that could see unit growth and presumably higher average selling prices. In response to these developments, Bernstein SocGen Group and other firms have updated their models and raised estimates for Broadcom.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

How MarketBeat Calculates Price Target and Consensus Rating

MarketBeat calculates consensus analyst ratings for stocks using the most recent rating from each Wall Street analyst that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Each analyst's rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Analyst consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Each stock's consensus analyst rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0 to .5 = Strong Sell, .5 to 1 = Sell, 1 to 1.5 = Reduce, 1.5 to 2.5 = Hold, 2.5 to 3.0 = Moderate Buy, 3.0 to 3.5 = Buy, \>3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.

*   Recent insider trading activity shows confidence in the company, with insiders selling shares but still holding significant positions, suggesting they believe in the company's long-term value.
*   The stock price is currently around $181.44, which may present a buying opportunity for investors looking to enter at a lower price point compared to its potential future growth.
*   Institutional investors own 76.43% of Broadcom's stock, reflecting strong institutional confidence and support, which can lead to more stability in stock performance.
*   Broadcom's focus on advanced semiconductor technology positions it well in a growing market, especially with the increasing demand for complex digital and mixed-signal devices.

### Broadcom  
Bear Case

![Image 70: red Wall Street bear icon](https://www.marketbeat.com/images/red-bear.svg)Investors should be bearish about investing in Broadcom for these reasons:

*   The high P/E ratio of 182.76 suggests that the stock may be overvalued compared to its earnings, which could deter value-focused investors.
*   Insider sales totaling 311,080 shares worth $53,540,590 over the last quarter may raise concerns about the company's short-term outlook and insider confidence.
*   The company's debt-to-equity ratio of 1.02 indicates a relatively high level of debt compared to equity, which could pose risks in a rising interest rate environment.
*   Recent fluctuations in stock performance may indicate volatility, which can be a concern for risk-averse investors.
*   With only 2.00% of the stock owned by insiders, there may be less alignment between management and shareholder interests, potentially impacting decision-making.

ASIC or GPU: Nvidia faces a significant competitor
==================================================

[![Image 29: avatar](https://auavatar.moomoo.com/20230208000016082850d1a0b4b.jpg/120?imageMogr2/ignore-error/1/format/webp)](https://www.moomoo.com/community/profile/moomoo-news-au-151000101)Verified Account

[Moomoo News AU](https://www.moomoo.com/community/profile/moomoo-news-au-151000101) joined discussion · Dec 17 18:56

[$Broadcom (AVGO.US)$](https://www.moomoo.com/stock/AVGO-US) stock surged 11.2% this Monday, following a 24.4% leap on last Friday's trading, marking its largest single-day percentage gain in history. According to Dow Jones Market Data, Friday's rally added $206 billion to its market value, which is the sixth-largest one-day gain for a U.S. company. **Broadcom is having its 'Nvidia moment'.** It has become the third semiconductor company in the world, after [$NVIDIA (NVDA.US)$](https://www.moomoo.com/stock/NVDA-US) and [$Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM.US)$](https://www.moomoo.com/stock/TSM-US), to surpass a market capitalization of one trillion dollars.

![Image 30: ASIC or GPU: Nvidia faces a significant competitor](https://sgsnsimg.moomoo.com/sns_client_feed/151000101/20241217/29b411b6ac8d41c1a7544d1ae9fb3d6d.png?area=102&is_public=true&imageMogr2/ignore-error/1/format/webp)

**Broadcom earnings soar, ASIC business looks bright**

Broadcom released its financial report for the fiscal year 2024 shows that the company's total revenue reached $51.6 billion, a year-on-year increase of 51%. Broadcom's main businesses are semiconductors and software. The software business revenue for the fiscal year 2024 reached $21.5 billion, accounting for nearly half of the total, with a significant year-on-year increase of 196%. Broadcom's semiconductor business generated revenue of $30.1 billion for the full fiscal year, a 7% increase from the previous year. The semiconductor business primarily includes network chips and ASIC custom chips. Both types of chips are currently enjoying rapid growth due to the boom in generative AI. The financial report indicates that the AI business, which includes network chips and ASIC custom chips, reached $12.2 billion, a substantial year-on-year increase of 220%.

**Broadcom's ASIC take on Nvidia's GPU**

Can Broadcom challenge Nvidia? It largely depends on the company's ASIC business. Unlike general-purpose integrated circuit products like CPU and GPU, ASIC is specialized chips designed for specific applications or tasks, offering customized design in terms of performance, power consumption, and size. During the Bitcoin mining boom, dedicated mining chips were a typical application of ASIC. In contrast, GPU has standardized specifications and can be used in any electronic device that meets their basic requirements, with [$NVIDIA (NVDA.US)$](https://www.moomoo.com/stock/NVDA-US), [$Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.US)$](https://www.moomoo.com/stock/AMD-US), and [$Intel (INTC.US)$](https://www.moomoo.com/stock/INTC-US) being major players. Broadcom and Nvidia are both in the chip manufacturing industry, but they differ in their focus. Broadcom primarily produces specialized AI ASIC chips designed to handle certain tasks according to specific product requirements, while Nvidia focuses on standardized, general-purpose GPU.

**AI computing thus gives rise to two paths: one represented by Nvidia's GPU, which is suitable for general high-performance computing, and the other by ASIC custom chips, which represent a specialized path.**

**The future direction of AI applications**

After the surge in popularity of large AI models, the initial demand primarily comes from cloud computing giants like [$Amazon (AMZN.US)$](https://www.moomoo.com/stock/AMZN-US) and [$Microsoft (MSFT.US)$](https://www.moomoo.com/stock/MSFT-US). These cloud behemoths are major buyers of AI chips, with Nvidia's GPU dominating the market with a near 90% share. As GPU production is strained and prices are high, and since Nvidia has set industry standards for both hardware and software ecosystems, customers cannot design products tailored to their specific business needs. Many tech giants are now developing their own ASIC for exclusive use.

**Broadcom is a key player in this arena, having co-developed the TPU AI accelerator chip with Google and participating in AI chip development programs for Meta and Apple.**

The early stage of large AI model pre-training requires high-performance, general-purpose chips capable of handling massive scales. However, the intense and large-scale model training is exhausting global databases, and as the marginal benefits of model expansion decrease, the cost of computing power remains high. This has sparked discussions on whether the AI training phase is about to end. **The stages of AI model development may change, with the next phase focusing on logical inference, which poses targeted requirements for the development and implementation of AI in various vertical fields.** Logical inference, as the next stage after pre-training of large models, involves developing AI applications in specific vertical areas to achieve practical deployment.

A recent report from Morgan Stanley is optimistic about the coexistence of these two technologies. **It suggests that the rise of ASIC does not signal the decline of GPU. Instead, ASIC will complement GPU, and both technologies will coexist long-term, offering optimal solutions for different scenarios.** The AI ASIC market is expected to grow from $12 billion in 2024 to $30 billion by 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of 34%.

**How to catch the new AI trend?**

In the supply chain for developing AI chips, [$Marvell Technology (MRVL.US)$](https://www.moomoo.com/stock/MRVL-US) and Broadcom have long been dominant manufacturers. In addition to major clients like Google and Microsoft, Marvell has recently signed a five-year cooperation agreement with Amazon AWS to assist in the design of Amazon's own AI chips. Industry insiders believe that this will propel Marvell's custom AI chip business to double its growth in the next fiscal year. It's worth paying attention to Marvell's performance. **Following Broadcom's earnings release, there has been a surge in call options, allowing investors to participate in the investment through options.**

Markdown Content:
When it comes to AI development beneficiaries, besides the hotshot NVIDIA, Broadcom definitely ranks high. As a leader in communication chips, Broadcom's network chips are essential for data transmission between AI chip clusters. Riding the AI wave, Broadcom's stock price has surged for two consecutive years, making it the second-largest chip giant by market value, just behind NVIDIA.

![Image 55: [December.2024] Decoding Broadcom earnings: the second-largest chip giant after Nvidia -1](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com//17338868120942578365874-pasted-img.png?imageMogr2/quality/100/ignore-error/1/format/webp)

Broadcom is set to release its latest earnings report soon. Each earnings release may present a promising trading or investment opportunity. But before diving in, investors need to understand how to interpret its performance. We may focus on four key areas: revenue growth, profitability, inventory changes, and cash flow and shareholder returns.

1\. Revenue growth
------------------

Broadcom is known as a big player in mergers and acquisitions, with historical deals totaling over $100 billion. This has resulted in a diverse business portfolio, offering thousands of chip and software-related products that span enterprise and data center networks, set-top boxes, telecom equipment, smartphones, and base stations.

Broadcom's revenue mainly comes from two segments: Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software.

Previously, Semiconductor Solutions accounted for nearly 80% of the total revenue. However, after acquiring VMware for $61 billion at the end of 2023, the software segment's revenue share jumped to over 40% by Q3 of the 2024 fiscal year.

![Image 56: [December.2024] Decoding Broadcom earnings: the second-largest chip giant after Nvidia -2](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com//17338868134463089148856-pasted-img.png?imageMogr2/quality/100/ignore-error/1/format/webp)

Historically, Broadcom has shown steady revenue growth, increasing year over year and even quarter over quarter since 2017. However, the revenue growth rate has experienced significant fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. From Q4 of the 2020 fiscal year, Broadcom enjoyed double-digit growth for ten consecutive quarters. Yet, starting from Q2 of 2023, the growth rate dipped for three quarters before bouncing back to over 10% in the most recent three quarters. The year-over-year growth went up to nearly 50% in Q3 2024.

![Image 57: [December.2024] Decoding Broadcom earnings: the second-largest chip giant after Nvidia -3](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com//17338868127443448324018-pasted-img.png?imageMogr2/quality/100/ignore-error/1/format/webp)

So, what does the future hold for Broadcom's revenue growth? Let's break it down by segment.

First, let's look at Broadcom's largest segment: the semiconductor business. This segment is further divided into Networking, Wireless Communication, Enterprise Storage, Broadband, and Industrial & Other in their earnings reports. The revenue growth for this segment remains steady at around 5%, primarily driven by the expansion of network operations.

But why is Networking performing so well? The answer may lie in the surge of AI development.

Training large AI models requires a significant number of high-performance chips, including NVIDIA GPUs. Connecting these chips requires Ethernet switches, routers, and other network chips, which fall squarely within Broadcom's Networking segment. Additionally, Broadcom's network chips are crucial for custom ASIC chips in the AI field. For example, Broadcom was deeply involved in the development of Google's custom AI server chip, the TPU AI accelerator.

Broadcom's other major segment, Infrastructure Software, has also shown steady growth over recent quarters. Since the start of the 2024 fiscal year, this segment's revenue growth has exceeded 100%, thanks to the added revenue from the VMware acquisition last year. Even without factoring in acquisitions, Broadcom's existing Infrastructure Software business has been accelerating its growth over the past few quarters, according to their financial reports.

![Image 58: [December.2024] Decoding Broadcom earnings: the second-largest chip giant after Nvidia -4](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com//17338868129803782908555-pasted-img.png?imageMogr2/quality/100/ignore-error/1/format/webp)

Looking ahead to future fiscal quarters, key areas to watch for Broadcom include whether AI development will continue to drive accelerated growth in the networking segment, if other semiconductor segments can stabilize and rebound as the industry cycle recovers, and whether the Infrastructure Software segment can maintain its steady upward revenue trend.

2\. Profitability
-----------------

The semiconductor industry has high technical barriers, but once a company dominates a particular field, it can achieve strong pricing power and profitability. As a leader in communication chips, Broadcom's profitability is among the highest in the semiconductor industry.

Examining various profitability metrics, Broadcom's gross margin increased from 61.9% in Q3 of fiscal 2021 to 69.4% in Q3 of fiscal 2023. During the same period, the adjusted net margin rose from 27.2% to 39.5%. Additionally, Broadcom's return on equity (ROE) reached an impressive 70% in fiscal 2023.

![Image 59: [December.2024] Decoding Broadcom earnings: the second-largest chip giant after Nvidia -5](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com//17338868121229786421312-pasted-img.png?imageMogr2/quality/100/ignore-error/1/format/webp)

However, in recent quarters, Broadcom has experienced a significant decline in profitability. Its gross margin dropped to 62.3% in Q1 of fiscal 2024, and the net margin fell to 11.1%. Net income was approximately $1.33 billion, down 64.5% year-over-year, marking the first profit decline in over a dozen quarters.

The primary reason for this decline is the integration costs and asset amortization associated with the VMware acquisition, which have negatively impacted Broadcom's overall profitability. In Q2 2024, the effects of these acquisition-related costs began to ease, but in Q3 2024, Broadcom reported a loss due to a one-time tax provision issue. In the coming quarters, we can monitor Broadcom's profitability recovery.

3\. Inventory changes
---------------------

The semiconductor industry is known for its growth potential and cyclical nature. Inventory levels are a key indicator of these cycles and growth expectations. When industry demand falls, and there is an oversupply, inventory levels rise, increasing sales pressure and potentially affecting stock prices. On the flip side, when demand picks up, inventory levels quickly drop, improving sales prospects.

A useful metric for tracking inventory changes is the inventory-to-revenue ratio. A higher ratio means higher inventory levels and more sales pressure.

Broadcom has consistently kept its inventory-to-revenue ratio below 30%, one of the lowest in the industry, highlighting its strong inventory management. However, this ratio does experience some cyclical fluctuations.

![Image 60: [December.2024] Decoding Broadcom earnings: the second-largest chip giant after Nvidia -6](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com//17338868121351535324116-pasted-img.png?imageMogr2/quality/100/ignore-error/1/format/webp)

Since the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, Broadcom's inventory-to-revenue ratio has been on the rise, increasing from 14.3% in Q1 2021 to 21.7% in Q3 2022. However, starting from Q4 2023, this ratio began to decline, reaching approximately 14.8% in Q2 2024. In future financial reports, we can continue to monitor Broadcom's inventory-to-revenue ratio to see if it can maintain these historically low levels.

4\. Cash flow and shareholder returns
-------------------------------------

As a major player in the semiconductor industry, Broadcom wields significant influence within the supply chain, resulting in minimal cash tied up in inventory and receivables. This translates to very robust cash flow. Since fiscal year 2018, Broadcom has generated a cumulative free cash flow of $85.5 billion, far exceeding its adjusted net income of less than $50 billion for the same period.

![Image 61: [December.2024] Decoding Broadcom earnings: the second-largest chip giant after Nvidia -7](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com//17338868140649970167660-pasted-img.png?imageMogr2/quality/100/ignore-error/1/format/webp)

Broadcom primarily uses its cash flow for business acquisitions and returning value to shareholders. In the U.S. stock market, many companies reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Dividends provide direct returns to shareholders, while buybacks can enhance the company's return on equity and earnings per share, inject additional liquidity into the market, and boost stock prices—a win-win that shareholders greatly appreciate.

From fiscal year 2018 to the first half of fiscal year 2024, Broadcom's cumulative dividends and buybacks totaled $80.2 billion, 1.6 times its adjusted net income over the same period. Notably, in the first half of fiscal year 2024 alone, dividends and buybacks reached $14.7 billion, nearly matching the total for the previous year. This demonstrates Broadcom's generosity in shareholder returns.

In future financial reports, we can continue to monitor whether Broadcom can maintain its strong performance in cash flow and shareholder returns.

![Image 62: [December.2024] Decoding Broadcom earnings: the second-largest chip giant after Nvidia -8](https://uscourseimg.moomoo.com//17338868137036213838725-pasted-img.png?imageMogr2/quality/100/ignore-error/1/format/webp)

Having read this far, you may now have a deeper understanding of how to interpret Broadcom's financial reports. It's noteworthy that the release of earnings reports from prominent companies may present unique trading opportunities for different types of investors.

For instance, if an investor, after analyzing past reports and considering recent developments, believes a company's latest earnings will send positive signals and boost the short-term stock price, they might consider taking a long position. This could involve buying the underlying stock or purchasing call [options](https://www.moomoo.com/us/learn/detail-what-are-options-117111-240394347).

Conversely, if the investor expects the earnings to be unfavorable and potentially pressure the stock price, they might consider taking a short position, either through short selling or buying put options.

If the report's outcome is unclear but volatility is expected, they might use a straddle strategy, buying both calls and puts.

However, investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance, particularly when considering high-risk trades like short selling or options, before making any trading decisions.

Summary

When evaluating Broadcom's performance, we should focus on several key areas: revenue growth, profitability, inventory changes, cash flow, and shareholder returns.

*   Revenue Growth: Monitor whether Broadcom's network and infrastructure software businesses can sustain accelerated growth. Additionally, keep an eye on the performance of Broadcom's other semiconductor businesses as the industry cycles through recovery phases.
    
*   Profitability: Broadcom is currently dealing with integration and amortization expenses following its acquisition of VMware. It will be important to observe any subsequent improvements in its gross and net margins.
    
*   Inventory Changes: Broadcom has historically maintained a low inventory-to-revenue ratio. We may continue to monitor whether it can sustain these historically low levels.
    
*   Cash Flow and Shareholder Returns: Broadcom has traditionally had strong cash flow and has been generous in returning value to shareholders. We may watch to see if this stable performance continues in the future.

Berkshire Hathaway is the lone nontech achiever

Shares of Broadcom Inc. were soaring Friday following a bullish forecast on sales of artificial-intelligence chips, putting the company on the cusp of becoming the next member of the trillion-dollar club.

Broadcom's stock (AVGO) shot up 19.4% in midday trading, sending it into record territory and putting it on track to break its record for a one-day gain of 15.8%, hit on March 29, 2020. That rally pushed the company's market capitalization up to $1.01 trillion.

Based on the latest disclosed count of 4.67 billion shares outstanding, Broadcom's market cap would officially hit $1 trillion if the stock closed at or above $214.11.

The $1 trillion club of U.S.-listed companies isn't overflowing with members, but Broadcom would be joining some familiar names within the technology sector, some of which have not found it easy to hang on at that level, at least at first.

In August 2018, Apple Inc. (AAPL) officially became the first-ever company to close a trading session with a $1 trillion market cap, and that has ballooned to $3.73 trillion in recent trading. Those who invested in the iPhone maker at the time it broke that $1 trillion level would have seen their shares gain about 376%.

Second on the current roster of the trillion-dollar club is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), with a market cap of $3.32 trillion. It first reached the $1 trillion mark in 2019, boosted at the time by cloud growth. Microsoft's stock is up around 242% since it first crossed the $1 trillion mark.

Broadcom's fellow AI-chip favorite, Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), vaulted to a $1 trillion market cap in June 2023 and has more than tripled that valuation since, with a current market cap of $3.27 trillion. Up 170% so far this year, Nvidia's stock has climbed around 226% since reaching the $1 trillion mark.

Read: 'Magnificent Seven' hits another milestone. Here's why it could continue to dominate the market in 2025.

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) had a battle at the start of its journey to $1 trillion, first touching that level in 2018, then failing to again close above it until February 2020. Billionaire Jeff Bezos's e-commerce giant currently boasts a market cap of $2.39 trillion, with the stock up around 211% since closing above the $1 trillion mark.

Read: Even after Amazon's 50% stock surge this year, these factors could spur more gains

Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is currently in fifth place, with a market cap of $2.34 trillion. The company first joined the club in January 2020, then was out, back in and out again as the COVID-19 pandemic hit, before rejoining for good in October of that year. The stock has run up 158% since the first trillion-dollar close.

Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms Inc. (META), with a market cap of $1.56 trillion, first reached the trillion-dollar milestone in mid-2021, only to fall below the level later that year and not reach it again until the beginning of 2024. Shares of Mark Zuckerberg's company are up around 76% since the valuation first crossed the $1 trillion line in 2021.

Tesla Inc. (TSLA) - whose CEO, Elon Musk, is himself worth $442 billion and is the wealthiest person on the planet - also did not have a smooth ride to the $1 trillion level. Tesla's market cap first reached that mark in October 2021, then lost its grip in December of that year, regained it briefly in April 2022, only to lose it again and not recapture it until November 2024.

Since the Nov. 5 presidential election in the U.S., following Musk's reputed quarter-billion-dollar bet on Donald Trump, a nearly 70% stock surge has added around $561.3 billion to Tesla's market cap, which currently stands at $1.37 trillion. Tesla's stock is only up about 19% from the time of its first bid to join the $1 trillion club, but it's 72% higher on the year as 2024 winds down.

This year also saw Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) reach the $1 trillion mark this summer, then again in October, with the semiconductor group remaining above the closely watched level with a market cap of $1.03 trillion. The stock is up 92% this year.

In the nontech camp, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A) stands alone. It closed a trading session with a $1 trillion market cap this summer and has hovered near that level since. The insurance, building-materials, railroad and soft-serve-ice-cream conglomerate's market cap stood at $915.8 billion in recent trading, with shares up 27% so far this year.

Hyperscalers are looking at ASIC chips to lower their costs of building out big AI data centers

Nvidia Corp. could start seeing some competition for its graphics processors for AI from custom chips over the next few years, as cloud companies and others start finding lower-cost solutions to the AI processing problem.

Wall Street began to realize how big that potential opportunity was this month, after the earnings calls of both Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) and Marvell Technology Inc. (MRVL). Both companies talked about big potential opportunities for their custom ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) chips, citing future plans of their hyperscaler customers.

ASICs, which have been around since the 1960s, are custom-designed semiconductors with specific functions, and therefore are more efficient than a general-purpose processor. Technically, GPUs are specialized chips designed initially for rendering graphics, but ASICs can be even more specialized, and therefore even faster at very specific tasks. In 2017, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Chris Rolland wrote in a note that he believed that ASICs could be long-term winners in the AI race.

Also read: A warning to Nvidia and AMD: GPUs may not hold the AI crown forever.

"While Nvidia GPUs are easier to program and are used for advanced AI development, hyperscalers are large enough that they want XPU ASICs that have lower total cost of ownership for internal and customer AI workloads," said Kevin Krewell, a principal analyst at Tirias Research, in an email. An XPU is traditionally a cross-architecture processor, but for Broadcom, XPU refers to its custom-designed high-performance accelerator chips.

One of Nvidia's key advantages is its CUDA software layer, which lets developers program Nvidia's GPUs for their specific needs. But as Broadcom Chief Executive Hok Tan said in the company's recent earnings call, three of its hyperscaler customers want to build clusters of 1 million custom XPUs across a single, open Ethernet network. "One million is a whole new game in terms of architecture," Tan said on the company's earnings call last week.

Nvidia recently began to support Ethernet for AI networking, but in the past it favored the more expensive InfiniBand networking architecture, which is largely used in the high-performance computing arena. Broadcom also has high-speed Ethernet networking chips which could be used in the massive clusters Tan described. Tan said networking chips would grow to 15% to 20% of its total AI silicon content, up from 5% to 10% today.

Broadcom appears to be seeing a bigger opportunity right now than Marvell, based on its recent whopping projection of a potential serviceable market in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in 2027. Tan made that projection based on the plans of those three hyperscalers, and the possibility of two others. Analysts believed that the three current customers are Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google, Meta (META) and TikTok parent ByteDance.

"Overall, the AI story seems to really be coming into its own," Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein Research analyst, wrote last week. "Perhaps Hock might think about shopping for a leather jacket," referencing Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang's iconic look.

When Rolland made his call on ASICs several years ago, he also pointed to the example of cryptocurrency mining, which started out using GPUs, but then many crypto miners switched to ASICs as their systems grew bigger. Rolland called Broadcom, Marvell and Microsemi, a subsidiary of Microchip Technology (MCHP), his best bets at the time for 2018.

Wall Street is now seeing the first inklings of that prediction playing out.

"Our sense is that investors do not yet fully appreciate that the computing industry is evolving from a ubiquitous, standard-merchant model to a fragmented, mixed merchant/custom-IC (integrated circuit) model in the data center that could grow to $50 billion over the next five years," wrote Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis, in a note to clients earlier this month. "Marvell is one of the two established vendors (along with Broadcom) that is positioned to capture a material piece of that business."

In early December, Marvell announced a five-year deal to provide Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) with chips, including custom AI chips for its web services business, AWS. Revenues in its custom silicon business are projected to go up more than previously expected, and it sees its AI revenue surging to over $1.5 billion in fiscal 2025, and to over $2.5 billion in fiscal 2026, up from over $550 million in fiscal 2024.

"There's already been a lot of noise in the system around these types of opportunities and applications," said Marvell Chief Executive Mark Murphy, adding that what is actually going to ship and represent the bulk of the volume in custom silicon for AI accelerators will be "from scaled-up companies like Marvell," that have the intellectual property, the roadmap and other capabilities. Google's Tensor processors are also custom ASICs.

Investors have already been getting slightly nervous about Nvidia's position as the leader and how it could potentially lose some of massive market share in AI. In the past month, Nvidia's shares have fallen about 11%, and are now considered in correction territory, while Broadcom has soared 45% and Marvell has jumped about 26%. These two new AI darlings, though, both have other business segments that are not growing as fast as AI.

And of course there is always the possibility that customers will decide to slow down their massive build-outs of data centers if the return on investment looks weaker. But for now, both Broadcom and Marvell appear to be having their Nvidia moments.

_Broadcom_ [_AVGO_](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/avgo/quote) _released its third-quarter earnings report on Dec. 12. Here’s Morningstar’s take on Broadcom’s earnings and stock._

Key Morningstar Metrics for Broadcom
------------------------------------

What We Thought of Broadcom’s Q3 Earnings
-----------------------------------------

Broadcom reported October-quarter revenue of $14.1 billion, rising 8% sequentially. In the longer term, management estimated the serviceable addressable market for artificial intelligence chips at its three largest customers to be $60 billion-$90 billion in fiscal 2027.

*   **The bottom line:** We raised our fair value estimate for Broadcom to $190 per share from $155 as we raised our AI revenue growth forecast for the firm. We now see shares as roughly fairly valued after a 15% jump after hours in response to strong results and guidance.
    *   We now forecast nearly 40% annual revenue growth for Broadcom’s AI chips through fiscal 2029, inclusive of more than 50% annual growth through fiscal 2027. This puts us on the conservative end of management’s SAM. We model $44.2 billion in AI chip revenue in fiscal 2027.
    *   To buy Broadcom shares today, we believe investors must believe in the midpoint or upper end of management’s SAM and expect Broadcom to retain a 70% share of this opportunity.
*   **Why it matters:** Broadcom’s SAM estimate for fiscal 2027 implies significantly higher AI revenue growth over the next three years than we expected, at a roughly 62% annual rate from fiscal 2024.
    *   We believe Broadcom has a path to a majority share of this future SAM. Management estimates its fiscal 2024 SAM to be $15 billion-$20 billion, which implies Broadcom holds a roughly 70% share with $12.2 billion in fiscal 2024 AI chip revenue.
    *   We see potential upside to management’s SAM, given Broadcom has just begun working with two more custom AI accelerator customers (who we believe to be Apple [AAPL](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/aapl/quote) and OpenAI) and sells its merchant networking chips for AI to a wider customer base.
*   **Big picture:** Broadcom’s impressive outlook for AI revenue adheres to our long-term thesis that the firm possesses differentiated chip design capabilities for high-performance networking and computing that allow it to capitalize on significant cloud investment and take market share.

  

Fair Value Estimate for Broadcom
--------------------------------

With its 2-star rating, we believe Broadcom’s stock is overvalued compared with our long-term fair value estimate of $190 per share. Our valuation implies a fiscal 2025 adjusted price/earnings multiple of 30 times and a fiscal 2025 enterprise value/sales multiple of 15 times.

In our view, Broadcom’s primary valuation drivers are the growth of its AI chip business and its ability to extract growth and operating leverage from VMware. We also anticipate continued inorganic growth over the long term. We model 18% revenue growth for Broadcom through fiscal 2029. We see high artificial intelligence sales driving supernormal growth in the next five years while longer-term durable growth settles at around 10% on an organic basis.

Economic Moat Rating
--------------------

We believe Broadcom has a wide moat, stemming from intangible assets in chip design and switching costs for its software products. The firm’s strength in both chips and software lets it earn terrific accounting and economic profits, and we believe its competitive positioning will likely allow it to do so for the next 20 years. Most of the company’s business is in semiconductors, with broad end-market exposure across enterprise networking, wireless chips for smartphones, broadband access, and storage applications. We see the two largest exposures here, networking and wireless chips, benefiting from the firm’s expertise in chip design.

Most of Broadcom’s business is in semiconductors, with broad end-market exposure across enterprise networking, wireless chips for smartphones, broadband access, and storage applications. We see the two largest exposures here—networking and wireless chips—benefiting from the firm’s wide-moat expertise in chip design.

Financial Strength
------------------

We anticipate Broadcom focusing on strong cash generation. Over the short term, we expect the firm to focus on paying down debt taken out to acquire VMware. Over the long term, we expect it to focus on growing its dividend and bolting on more acquisitions to add to its cash flow. As of October 2024, Broadcom held $9 billion in cash and equivalents versus $68 billion in gross debt, with approximately half of that taken on to finance the 2023 acquisition of VMware. We don’t worry about its debt load, given the long-dated nature of its outstanding notes and its robust cash generation. After Broadcom’s gross debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio rose to 3.5 times after closing on VMware, the firm exited fiscal 2024 with that figure down to 2.1 times.

Risk and Uncertainty
--------------------

We assign a Medium Uncertainty Rating to Broadcom. As a chipmaker, it is vulnerable to market supply and demand cycles. Though it has been able to offset cyclicality in recent years with its software exposure and networking strength as a buoy, future cycles may not look similar. It also heavily relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing [TSM](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/tsm/quote) for its chips, and any supply constraints could hamper its ability to ship to customers. Nonetheless, we believe Broadcom is a preferred customer of Taiwan Semiconductor and would receive high priority in such a scenario, both for its scale and lengthy relationship.

AVGO Bulls Say
--------------

*   Broadcom is a poster child for operating efficiency. It earns excellent operating margins and generates enormous cash flow. It is particularly strong at acquiring companies and trimming excess expenses.
*   Broadcom’s networking and wireless chip businesses boast best-of-breed technologies, along with marquee customer relationships with Apple [AAPL](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/aapl/quote), Alphabet, Cisco Systems [CSCO](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/csco/quote), Arista Networks [ANET](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/anet/quote), and others.
*   We believe Broadcom will significantly benefit from rising AI spending, which we expect to spur significant growth for its networking semiconductor sales.

AVGO Bears Say
--------------

*   Broadcom has sizable exposure to non-moaty businesses, like its broadband and storage chips.
*   Broadcom’s software portfolio holds many legacy and mature businesses, like virtualization and mainframes, which we think will exhibit lower growth.
*   Broadcom relies heavily on acquisitions to expand its portfolio, yet tends to focus more on expense cutting rather than seek strategic synergies for its deals.

The [**semiconductor**](https://www.marketbeat.com/compare-stocks/semiconductor-stocks/) and [**data center**](https://www.marketbeat.com/compare-stocks/cloud-storage/) sectors are fast-paced and volatile, with companies like [**NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA)**](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/nvda) and [**Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD)**](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/amd) leading the way. However, a giant is quietly revolutionizing the sector and becoming a force to be reckoned with in the [**artificial intelligence**](https://www.marketbeat.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence-stocks/) (AI) revolution. While many may overlook this diversified technology company, [**Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO)**](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/avgo) is growing its AI capabilities and making strategic investments that generate positive investor sentiment.

**A Multifaceted Technological Powerhouse**
-------------------------------------------

Broadcom is a technology company with a vast portfolio spanning 26 divisions, offering a diverse range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Its offerings include network connectivity chips for data centers, server storage, broadband and wireless products, cybersecurity, and cloud computing solutions. This broad reach gives Broadcom a distinct advantage, enabling it to capitalize on emerging trends across multiple technology sub-sectors.

The semiconductor industry is experiencing rapid growth, driven by the rise of AI. Companies like NVIDIA and AMD have emerged as industry leaders, attracting significant investment and attention. However, Broadcom offers a more stable and less volatile approach with its [**diversified portfolio**](https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/diversification-can-smooth-returns-and-mitigate-portfolio-risk/). It provides a more balanced investment opportunity that is less dependent on the volatile swings of a single market.

**Broadcom's AI Strategy: A Quiet Revolution**
----------------------------------------------

Broadcom's strategy has been to invest steadily in AI chips and data center infrastructure. This includes developing high-performance networking chips and storage solutions specifically designed to support the demands of AI workloads. This strategic focus is crucial for the company's future growth as the need for advanced chips and infrastructure to power AI applications continues to increase.

A key milestone in Broadcom's AI strategy was its November 2023 acquisition of VMware, a leading cloud architecture software company. This acquisition significantly bolstered Broadcom's AI software and cloud infrastructure position, giving it a more comprehensive and integrated offering.

VMware's expertise in system virtualization and cloud management perfectly complements Broadcom's hardware capabilities, enabling the company to offer end-to-end solutions for data centers, cloud computing, virtual systems, servers, and AI deployments.

The integration of VMware into Broadcom's operations has been a complex process that has presented challenges and opportunities. However, the company has shown confidence that the acquisition will drive significant growth and enhance its competitiveness in the AI market.

**The Latest Earnings Report: A Glimpse Into Growth**
-----------------------------------------------------

Broadcom's earnings report for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 provided valuable insights into the company's performance and effectiveness in its AI strategy. The company reported impressive revenue growth of 47% year over year, reaching $13.1 billion.

While this growth is impressive, it's important to note that a significant portion is attributed to VMware's acquisition, strengthening the infrastructure software segment. Excluding VMware, Broadcom's organic revenue growth was only 4% year-over-year. This suggests that the company's core business, specifically its semiconductor solutions segment, is not yet seeing the same level of growth as its AI-focused peers.

However, it is crucial to remember that Broadcom's semiconductor solutions segment, primarily focused on non-AI applications, is starting to show signs of stabilization. Broadcom's CEO, Hock Tan, has stated that "non-AI semiconductor revenue has stabilized" and that the company is "expecting a recovery" in the coming quarters. The executive's comments suggest Broadcom's non-AI businesses are at a turning point and potentially ready to drive future growth.

In addition to revenue, Broadcom reported adjusted [**EBITDA**](https://www.marketbeat.com/financial-terms/what-is-ebitda-and-why-does-it-matter/) of $8.223 billion for the quarter, representing 63% of revenue, a notable increase of 42% year-over-year. This demonstrates the company's continued focus on profitability and its ability to generate cash flow. The company also highlighted that adjusted EBITDA for the upcoming quarter is expected to reach approximately 64% of projected revenue.

The strong adjusted EBITDA performance is another [positive sign for investors](https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/broadcom-serves-up-a-trend-following-entry-for-investors/). It suggests that Broadcom is managing its costs effectively and generating significant cash flow despite the ongoing transition in its core business and the integration of VMware.

[**Broadcom's financial**](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/avgofinancials/) performance and its AI strategy are closely intertwined. During the[earnings call](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/earnings) Tan also said that revenue from AI products will drive $12 billion in annual sales this year, up from the prior company estimate of $11 billion. The company's commitment to AI is evident in its focus on developing and deploying advanced chips and solutions for data centers and other critical applications.

**Analyst Recommendations and the Investment Outlook**
------------------------------------------------------

[**Broadcom’s analyst**](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/avgoforecast/) community is generally optimistic about the company’s future. The average price target for [**Broadcom stock**](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/avgochart/) is $189.23, representing a potential upside of 29.37% from the current price. Of 25 analysts covering the stock, 24 recommend buying it, while one recommends holding it. This "Moderate Buy" consensus rating indicates a generally positive market sentiment toward Broadcom.

**A Final Thought: Broadcom's AI Powerhouse Emerges**
-----------------------------------------------------

Broadcom's AI revolution is quietly unfolding. While its current growth relies heavily on VMware, the company is strategically positioning itself as a dominant player in the AI space. Its non-AI businesses show signs of recovery, and AI drives strong revenue growth. The company's valuation relative to its peers, its commitment to AI, and the positive outlook from analysts make Broadcom an intriguing investment opportunity for investors with a long-term time horizon.

As Broadcom continues developing its AI capabilities and integrating VMware into its operations, investors might benefit from its quiet transformation into an AI powerhouse. Broadcom's journey to becoming a leader in AI is far from over, and the company's potential for future growth is significant. The market's current underestimation of Broadcom's AI strategy may present a window of opportunity for investors willing to look beyond the short term and embrace the potential of this quietly growing technology leader.

**Broadcom** [(NASDAQ: AVGO)](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/avgo) has been an outstanding investment over the past three years, as shares of the semiconductor giant have shot up an impressive 240% during this time and outpaced the 27% gains clocked by the **PHLX Semiconductor Sector** index over the same period.

Investors may be wondering if this chipmaker has enough fuel in the tank to sustain its impressive rally for the next three years as well and if it is worth buying Broadcom stock following the solid gains it has already clocked. In this article, we will examine Broadcom's catalysts for the next three years, check to see if this semiconductor stock is capable of delivering more upside, and analyze its valuation to find out if it is still a good bet for investors looking to add a chip stock to their portfolios.

A massive catalyst could power years of growth for Broadcom
-----------------------------------------------------------

Broadcom recently announced its results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on Nov. 3). The company's annual revenue grew 44% from the previous year to a record $51.6 billion. Broadcom's organic revenue growth stood at 9% for the year after, excluding the contribution from VMware, which was acquired in November last year.

The chipmaker's fiscal 2024 [non-GAAP](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/gaap-vs-non-gaap/?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=8d365036-b0d7-4964-832c-2cc7b5aef829) (adjusted) earnings came in at $4.87 per share, an improvement of 15% from the previous year. The good part is that Broadcom's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 suggests that it is on track to grow at a faster pace this year. The company has guided for $14.6 billion in revenue for the current quarter, which would be a 22% increase over the year-ago period.

Though Broadcom hasn't issued full-year guidance, analysts are expecting the company's top line to increase by almost 19% in the current fiscal year to $61.1 billion. Even better, the semiconductor specialist's top line is expected to clock 15% growth over the next couple of fiscal years as well.

[![Image 11: AVGO Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.ycharts.com%2Fcharts%2F9c645d5a89e4acaad516fc0a76713a5d.png&w=700)](https://ycharts.com/companies/AVGO/chart/)

[AVGO Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year](https://ycharts.com/companies/AVGO/sales_est_0y) data by [YCharts](https://ycharts.com/)

The important thing to note in the chart above is that Broadcom's revenue estimates have been hiked sizably for all three fiscal years. That can be attributed to the fast-growing demand for Broadcom's [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.fool.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence/?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=8d365036-b0d7-4964-832c-2cc7b5aef829) chips, which are being deployed in data centers for AI model training and inference, as well as to enable faster connectivity between servers for tackling AI workloads.

More specifically, Broadcom's AI revenue shot up an incredible 220% in fiscal 2024 to $12.2 billion. The company expects solid growth in the AI business in the current quarter as well, forecasting a 65% year-over-year increase in revenue from sales of AI chips to $3.8 billion. However, don't be surprised to see Broadcom's AI revenue growth getting even better as the year progresses.

That's because two additional hyperscale customers have selected Broadcom's custom AI processors for deployment. Its custom chips are [already used by major cloud service providers](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/05/28/1-unstoppable-stock-that-could-join-nvidia-micro/?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=8d365036-b0d7-4964-832c-2cc7b5aef829) that are looking to reduce their dependence on expensive graphics cards from **Nvidia** for their AI needs. The expansion of the company's customer base will put it in a stronger position to make the most of a massive growth opportunity.

Broadcom management remarked on the latest [earnings conference call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/12/12/broadcom-avgo-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript/?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=8d365036-b0d7-4964-832c-2cc7b5aef829) that the serviceable addressable market for its custom AI accelerators and networking chips could range between $60 billion and $90 billion by fiscal 2027. Assuming the size of the market lands at the midpoint of $75 billion, and Broadcom manages to sustain even a 50% share of the custom chip market at that time as compared to its current market share of 55% to 60%, according to **JPMorgan**, its AI revenue could hit $37.5 billion in fiscal 2027.

That would be nearly triple the AI revenue that Broadcom generated in the previous fiscal year. However, if Broadcom manages to maintain its share of the custom chip market at 60%, and the size of the market indeed hits $90 billion as per the company's estimates, then its revenue from AI-related sales could easily exceed $50 billion.

In that case, Broadcom's overall revenue in fiscal 2027 could be well above analysts' expectations that we saw in the chart earlier since its incremental AI revenue could jump by around $40 billion from last year's levels (assuming Broadcom's other business segments don't show any growth).

Is the stock still worth buying?
--------------------------------

The good part about Broadcom is that it is still trading at an attractive 35 times [forward earnings](https://www.fool.com/terms/f/forward-pe/?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=8d365036-b0d7-4964-832c-2cc7b5aef829). That isn't very expensive when we consider that the **Nasdaq-100** index (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks) has an identical price-to-earnings ratio.

What's more, Broadcom's price/earnings-to-growth ratio ([PEG ratio](https://www.fool.com/terms/p/peg-ratio/?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=8d365036-b0d7-4964-832c-2cc7b5aef829)) is just 0.63 as per Yahoo! Finance, based on the five-year earnings growth that the company is expected to deliver. A PEG ratio of less than 1 means that a stock is cheap with respect to its estimated earnings growth over the next five years, and Broadcom is quite attractive on this front.

So, investors looking to add an [AI stock](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/ai-stocks/machine-learning-stocks/?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=8d365036-b0d7-4964-832c-2cc7b5aef829) that is attractively valued and capable of delivering strong gains over the next three years to their portfolios can consider buying Broadcom as it seems well placed to sustain its rally.

PALO ALTO, Calif., Sept. 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Broadcom Inc. (Nasdaq: AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, today reported financial results for its third quarter of fiscal year 2024, ended August 4, 2024, provided guidance for its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 and announced its quarterly dividend.

"Broadcom's third quarter results reflect continued strength in our AI semiconductor solutions and VMware. We expect revenue from AI to be $12 billion for fiscal year 2024 driven by Ethernet networking and custom accelerators for AI data centers," said Hock Tan, President and CEO of Broadcom Inc. "The transformation of VMware continues to progress very well. The integration of VMware is driving adjusted EBITDA margin to 64% of revenue as we exit fiscal year 2024."

"Consolidated revenue grew 47% year-over-year to $13.1 billion, including the contribution from VMware, and was up 4% year-over-year, excluding VMware. Adjusted EBITDA increased 42% year-over-year to $8.2 billion," said Kirsten Spears, CFO of Broadcom Inc. "Free cash flow, excluding restructuring and integration in the quarter, was $5.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year."

(1) GAAP net loss of $1,875 million for the third quarter included a one-time discrete non-cash tax provision of $4.5 billion from the impact of an intra-group transfer of certain IP rights to the United States as a result of supply chain realignment. 




(2) The Company is not readily able to provide a reconciliation of the projected non-GAAP financial information presented to the relevant projected GAAP measure without unreasonable effort.

The Company's cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal quarter were $9,952 million, compared to $9,809 million at the end of the prior quarter.

During the third fiscal quarter, the Company generated $4,963 million in cash from operations and spent $172 million on capital expenditures. The Company paid $1,350 million of withholding taxes related to net settled equity awards that vested in the quarter (resulting in the elimination of 8.4 million shares).

On June 28, 2024, the Company paid a cash dividend on a split adjusted basis of $0.525 per share, totaling $2,452 million.

On July 12, 2024, the Company completed a ten-for-one forward stock split. All share and per-share amounts presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.

The differences between the Company's GAAP and non-GAAP results are described generally under "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below and presented in detail in the financial reconciliation tables attached to this release.

Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Business Outlook

Based on current business trends and conditions, the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, ending November 3, 2024, is expected to be as follows: 

Fourth quarter revenue guidance of approximately $14.0 billion; and
Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA guidance of approximately 64 percent of projected revenue.

The guidance provided above is only an estimate of what the Company believes is realizable as of the date of this release. The Company is not readily able to provide a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA to projected net income without unreasonable effort. Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material. The Company undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise any of these projections, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

Quarterly Dividends

The Company's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.53 per share. The dividend is payable on September 30, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on September 19, 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release. Broadcom believes non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Company's on-going performance. Therefore, Broadcom provides this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Company's on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. 

In addition to GAAP reporting, Broadcom provides investors with net income, operating income, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow and other data on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, non-GAAP tax reconciling adjustments, and other adjustments. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of the Company's underlying performance. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating the core operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their operations compare to the Company's operations, and benchmarking performance externally against the Company's competitors. The exclusion of these and other similar items from Broadcom's non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual.

Free cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Investors should not consider presentation of free cash flow measures as implying that stockholders have any right to such cash. Broadcom's free cash flow may not be calculated in a manner comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.

(1) Non-GAAP tax reconciling adjustments included a one-time discrete non-cash tax provision of $4.5 billion from the impact of an intra-group transfer
of certain IP rights to the United States as a result of supply chain realignment for the fiscal quarter and three fiscal quarters ended August 4, 2024.

	
	
	
	
	
	



(2) Non-GAAP adjustment for the number of shares used in the diluted per share calculations excludes the impact of stock-based
compensation expense expected to be incurred in future periods and not yet recognized in the financial statements, which would otherwise be
assumed to be used to repurchase shares under the GAAP treasury stock method. For the fiscal quarter ended August 4, 2024, non-GAAP
adjustment included the dilutive effect of the equity awards that were antidilutive on a GAAP basis.

Disclaimer: The TipRanks Smart Score performance is based on backtested results. Backtested performance is not an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses. General assumptions include: XYZ firm would have been able to purchase the securities recommended by the model and the markets were sufficiently liquid to permit all trading. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the backtested returns presented. Certain assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representations and warranties are made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance is developed with the benefit of hindsight and has inherent limitations. Specifically, backtested results do not reflect actual trading or the effect of material economic and market factors on the decision-making process. Since trades have not actually been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, and may not reflect the impact that certain economic or market factors may have had on the decision-making process. Further, backtesting allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted until past returns are maximized. Actual performance may differ significantly from backtested performance. Backtested results are adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented gross-of fees and do not include the effect of backtested transaction costs, management fees, performance fees or expenses, if applicable. Please note all regulatory considerations regarding the presentation of fees must be taken into account. No cash balance or cash flow is included in the calculation.

Title: Limitless Future of Custom ASIC Design

URL Source: https://www.ust.com/en/insights/the-limitless-future-of-custom-asic-design

Markdown Content:
For much of its history, the semiconductor or integrated circuits (IC), was a standardized chip that powered multiple types of devices. But exponential technological advancements such as automation and the Internet of Things (IoT) have accelerated the use of customized devices with specific hardware requirements. In addition, these devices produce gigabytes of meaningful data daily, creating a great strain on the one-size-fits-all semiconductor.

As technology companies continue to explore ways to harness personal data and create a universe of interconnected devices, the chip will remain the backbone of modern computing. But the industry is changing, and the types of chips companies want are also changing.

As we discussed in our previous blog, large technology companies have begun creating specialized chips so they can own more intellectual property, avoid supply chain delays, and drive deeper enhancements and customizations. Companies like Apple and Google (among other competitors) are building chips that feature end-to-end backward integration from their design agreements.

Semiconductor companies, facing threats from multiple corners, can still compete with internally-made chips by manufacturing application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) design (i.e., customized chips made for specific devices).

KEY TAKEAWAYS
-------------

*   Increased device specialization requires custom-built semiconductors, called application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips
*   ASIC helps keep energy low while aiding the transmission of data through interconnected devices
*   Bitcoin mining is one trend that is driving significant investment in ASIC
*   Other industries, such as automotive, are also driving interest

WHAT IS AN ASIC CHIP
--------------------

ASICs are chips designed for a client’s specific hardware or software solution instead of standard-purpose ICs, which work with multiple types of devices.

Custom ASIC design can cost from $200 million to $300 million based on the size and complexity, according to ISG. While that is a significant expenditure, companies can amortize that cost over time, making it more palatable to build internally than purchase from external vendors. So traditional semiconductor companies must demonstrate the value they provide their customers to dissuade them from building their own chips.

THE MOVE TO ASICS
-----------------

As a dominant semiconductor manufacturer, Intel has invested heavily in ASIC “purpose-built processors.” This way, it has a product offering for every type of client and can compete against other semiconductor manufacturers and offer a valuable alternative to companies looking to build their own.

All large semiconductor manufacturers are now producing ASIC chips, including Intel, AMD, Samsung, Nvidia, Texas Instruments, and others. [KBV Research predicts](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4900427/global-asic-chip-market-2019-2025) that the global ASIC Chip Market size will reach $24.7 billion by 2025, due to several trends driving adoption.

WHY THEY’RE IN DEMAND
---------------------

**The Internet of Things' Future:** Our smart devices ambiently communicate with each other through the Internet of Things to provide greater value to customers. So you not only need to be able to control your smart thermometer from a mobile device, but that thermometer also needs to directly tap into a weather API to make decisions on whether to heat (or cool) the house depending on external temperatures. It also can sense the external temperature of the house to alert the fire department if there is a fire in the kitchen. These new functionalities require custom chips to remain effective in their core functionality while doing these other functions.

**Power Management:** Traditional chips that powered computers and other devices that users manually booted up and shut down could run at full power because the user controlled when the device was on or not. The IoT devices mentioned above are effectively always on (to produce maximum value), so they need intelligent and customized chips that know when to power up and down depending on usage.

**Size:** ASIC chips are [usually smaller](https://www.sigenics.com/blog/what-is-an-asic) than standard chips, which will always be an important factor as devices get smaller and smaller (for portability's sake).

**Data:** Today’s devices are creating important data that can be studied and utilized to improve their performance and provide us with more information about our health (wearables), our energy usage (smart thermometers and refrigerators), our quality of life (smartphones), and more. According to [semiconductor manufacturer Intel](https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/intel-acquire-barefoot-networks/#gs.8d06dr), “half of the world’s data was generated in the past two years, and only 2% of that data has been analyzed.” The world is creating many different use cases for intelligent devices, all of which need small but powerful chips to power data intake and its transmission to be collected by other devices.

**The Crypto Future:** Intel has made [waves recently in the bitcoin space](https://compassmining.io/education/intel-asic-chip-manufacturing/), on the heels of acquiring a patent for a bitcoin mining hardware accelerator in [2018](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/how-intel-will-change-bitcoin-mining-industry) that reduced the energy consumption of bitcoin mining while increasing output. It requires incredible processing power and energy to mine bitcoins, and Intel could easily become a major player in providing ASIC chips geared toward this space.

As [bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies](https://www.yahoo.com/video/rise-asics-step-step-history-094335454.html) grow in importance, users will win and lose based on the power of their mining equipment. To successfully mine, they must make many calculations to embed transactions on the blockchain.

**The Automotive Space:** As we discussed in a previous blog, automotive companies are increasingly building smart cars and electric vehicles, all of which require hyper-specialized chips to power new functionality. The promise of self-driving cars requires incredibly powerful and intelligent ASICs to enable the array of sensors required to avoid humans, roadblocks, and other elements that the car’s computer must sense to avoid. The creation of customized chips becomes that much more important when lives are on the line.

UST’S CUSTOMIZED APPROACH
-------------------------

As ISG described in its recent paper highlighting UST as a leader in the hi-tech engineering industry, manufacturers increasingly need to create reusable framework structures. Our approach is a collaborative journey where we co-create with our clients, realizing a joint vision for their future. We use a custom framework that taps into our expertise, helping most of the world’s top 35 semiconductor companies and our innovation ecosystem to produce the best results for our clients.

UST: A HI-TECH ENGINEERING LEADER
---------------------------------

ISG ranks companies into four buckets: Leader (comprehensive product and service offering and advanced market presence), Challenger (excellent service and technology stacks and a willingness to improve their market presence and competitive strengths), Market Challenger (burgeoning presence and established and well-known vendors in their chosen industries), and Contender (demonstrating evidence of investments in the field and goal of becoming a Product or Market Challenger within 12 to 18 months). ISG believes that UST is in a competitive position thanks to its comprehensive product and service offering and strong market presence.

The growing enterprise demand for ASICs has created a huge opportunity for UST, according to ISG, as it is one of a few consultancies with a global footprint and end-to-end engineering capabilities.

In addition to work on custom ASIC, ISG cited UST’s engineering and R&D service expertise in semiconductor R&D, outsourcing, ODCs, and derivative design as key differentiators.

Looking ahead, the company forecast first-quarter revenue of $14.6 billion, in line with analyst estimates, and an EBITDA margin of 66%.

Broadcom highlighted a record $30.1 billion in semiconductor revenue for fiscal 2024, driven by a staggering 220% year-on-year growth in AI-related products, which contributed $12.2 billion. The company's AI XPU and Ethernet networking portfolio were key growth drivers. Moreover, Broadcom announced an 11% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.59 per share.

The company remains optimistic about its AI prospects, projecting a 65% jump in AI-related sales in the first quarter, outpacing the broader semiconductor segment's expected 10% growth. With the acquisition of two significant hyperscaler customers and a forecast of a $90 billion AI data center component market by 2027, Broadcom is well-positioned to capitalize on the AI boom.

Despite concerns about a potential slowdown in the chip design business, including a delayed launch of a new processor for Alphabet, Broadcom delivered solid fourth-quarter results. While there may be some uncertainty regarding Apple's future plans, Broadcom's continued collaboration with the tech giant and its focus on AI present significant growth opportunities.

Recent analyst upgrades from firms like Bank of America and JP Morgan, with price targets reaching $250, underscore the market's bullish sentiment towards Broadcom's AI initiatives. Many analysts anticipate a threefold increase in the company's AI segment over the next three years.
